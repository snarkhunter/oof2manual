<para>
  <classname>EdgeFromNodes</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BoundaryConstructor"/>, used as the
  <varname>constructor</varname> argument of the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Boundary.Construct"/> command when
  building &skel; <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundaries</link>.  It
  creates <link linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge'>Edge
  Boundaries</link> from the currently <link
  linkend='MenuItem-OOF.SegmentSelection'>selected</link> &skel;
  &nodes; or from a <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Groups'>group</link> of &nodes;.
  The &nodes; are specified by the <varname>group</varname> parameter,
  which must be either the name of a &node; group or the special <xref
  linkend="Object-Placeholder"/> object,
  <userinput>selection</userinput>.
</para>
<para>
  Edge boundaries must be constructed from a single contiguous
  non-branching set of &sgmts;.  To create an edge boundary,
  therefore, &oof2; must be able to find a unique path from &node; to
  &node; along the &sgmts; joining them, passing through all of the
  selected &nodes; exactly once.  This is a version of the <ulink
  url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path_problem"
  role="external">Hamiltonian path problem</ulink>, which is
  NP-complete.  That means that solving it is computationally
  expensive when the number of &nodes; is large.  However, if the
  selected set is not too large and is more or less linear
  (<foreignphrase>i.e</foreignphrase>, it defines a reasonable
  boundary) then &oof2; will be able to find the path quickly.
</para>
<para>
  Not all sets of &nodes; define a set of &sgmts;, and some sets of
  &nodes; can define more than one set of &sgmts;.  In those cases,
  <classname>EdgeFromNodes</classname> will fail and no boundary will
  be defined.  In the GUI, the <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button in the
  dialog box will be disabled if the &nodes; don't define exactly one
  linearly connected set of &sgmts;.  See <xref
  linkend="Figure-edge_from_nodes0"/> to
  <xref linkend="Figure-edge_from_nodes4"/> for some examples of
  configurations that do and do not define edge boundaries.
</para>
<para>
  Edge boundaries must be <emphasis>directed</emphasis>. <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition">Boundary
  conditions</link> use the direction to determine the boundary normal
  and the direction of applied &fields; and &fluxes;.  The
  <varname>direction</varname> parameter specifies the direction of
  the boundary being created.  The legal values for
  <varname>direction</varname> depend on the topology of the boundary
  being constructed.  When the &sgmts; form a closed loop, the legal
  values are <userinput>'Clockwise'</userinput> and
  <userinput>'CounterClockwise'</userinput>.  When the &sgmts; form an
  open line or curve, the values are <userinput>'Left to
  right'</userinput>, <userinput>'Right to left'</userinput>,
  <userinput>'Top to bottom'</userinput>, and <userinput>'Bottom to
  top'</userinput>.  &oof2; compares the positions of only the first
  and last &nodes; when determining the direction of an open boundary.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>EdgeFromNodes</classname> will always create a closed
  boundary if the set of &nodes; allows it.  To create an open
  boundary from a set of &nodes; that also defines a closed boundary,
  first create the closed boundary and then use <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Boundary.Modify"/> to remove one or
  more &sgmts; from it.
