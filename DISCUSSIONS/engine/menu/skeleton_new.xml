<para>
  This command creates a new &skel; in a &micro;.  The new &skel; has
  the same physical height and width as the &micro;.  It's divided
  into a rectangular array of cells, <varname>x_elements</varname> by
  <varname>y_elements</varname>.  The
  <varname>skeleton_geometry</varname> parameter determines whether
  each cell becomes one rectangular &elem; or two triangular &elems;.
  If they are triangular, an <xref linkend="Enum-Arrangement"/> object
  determines how the cells are split.  See <xref
  linkend="Enum-Arrangement"/> for illustrations.

<para>
  Since the mesh can be <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Refine">refined</link> and otherwise <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Modify">modified</link>, choosing the
  optimal values of <varname>x_elements</varname> and
  <varname>y_elements</varname> is not crucial, but it helps to start
  with reasonable values.  They should be set so that the element size
  is smaller than the <emphasis>largest</emphasis> features that need
  to be resolved in the &micro;.  In the end, every feature in the
  &micro; should contain at least a few elements.  Having many more
  elements is inefficient.  Starting with very large elements and
  refining all of them is less efficient than starting with smaller
  elements and refining some of them.
