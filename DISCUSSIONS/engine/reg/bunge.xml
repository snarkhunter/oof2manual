  <para>
    A <classname>Bunge</classname> object represents the orientation
    of a three dimensional object, assumed to be a crystal, in three
    dimensional space in terms of three angles,
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\phi_1\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>,
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\Theta\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>,
    and <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\phi_2\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>,
    corresponding to rotations which
    bring the lab (or screen) axes &xhat;, &yhat;, and &zhat; into
    coincidence with the crystalline &ahat;, &bhat;, and &chat;, axes,
    respectively.  This is the conventional usage of the texture
    community, and is the <emphasis>opposite</emphasis> of the usual
    sense for rotations in &oof2;.
  </para>
  <para>
    With this important difference, it resembles the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-X"/> convention, in that the axis
    selection and ordering are the same.  The <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\phi_1\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    rotation is about the initial
    <emphasis>laboratory</emphasis> axis &zhat;, the second
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\Theta\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    rotation is about the rotated laboratory &xhat; axis, and the
    third
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\phi_2\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    rotation is about the rotated
    &zhat; axis.
  </para>
  <para>
    The &oof2; implementation of this method actually constructs the
    usual &oof2; rotation matrix (which takes the crystalline axes
    into the laboratory axes), but does so from the conventionally
    specified Bunge parameters.  Users familiar with the
    <classname>Bunge</classname> convention can thus use previously
    obtained or instrument provided angles directly.
