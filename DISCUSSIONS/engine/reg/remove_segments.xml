<para>
  <classname>RemoveSegments</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BoundaryModifier"/>, used as the
  <varname>modifier</varname> argument of the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Boundary.Modify"/> command when
  editing &skel; <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundaries</link>.  It
  removes a set of &sgmts; from the boundary specified in the
  <varname>boundary</varname> argument of the
  <command>Modify</command> command.  The boundary must be an <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge'>edge
  boundary</link>.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>group</varname> parameter specifies which &sgmts; are
  to be removed from the boundary.  It must be either the name of a
  &sgmt; <link linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Groups'>group</link>
  or the special <xref linkend="Object-Placeholder"/> object,
  <userinput>selection</userinput>, referring to the currently <link
  linkend='MenuItem-OOF.SegmentSelection'>selected</link> &skel;
  &sgmts;.  If the given group or selection contains &sgmts; that are
  not actually in the boundary, those &sgmts; will be ignored.
</para>
<para>
  Edge boundaries must be constructed from a single contiguous
  non-branching set of &sgmts;.  It is an error to remove &sgmts; from
  a boundary if doing so would split the boundary into two or more
  pieces.

        of removing the &sgmts; from the boundary. The &sgmt; on the
        left edge wasn't in the boundary and was ignored.
