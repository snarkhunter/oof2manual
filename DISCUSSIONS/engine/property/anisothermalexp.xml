<para>
  An anisotropic thermal expansion &property; makes an additive

    <alt role="tex">
      \[ -C_{ijkl} \alpha_{kl} (T-T_0) \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  to the <xref linkend="Flux-Stress"/>, where <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(C_{ijkl}\)</alt></inlineequation> is the &material;'s
  <link linkend="PropertyType-Elasticity">elastic</link> modulus, and
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(T\)</alt></inlineequation> is the

<para>
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\alpha_{kl}\)</alt></inlineequation>
  is the thermal expansion coefficient, which is a symmetric second
  rank tensor given by the parameter <varname>alpha</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(T_0\)</alt></inlineequation> is
  equal to the parameter <varname>T0</varname>.  It is the temperature
  at which the thermal strain vanishes.
</para>
<para>
  The crystal symmetry of the material is reflected by the symmetry of
  the thermal expansion coefficient, <varname>alpha</varname>.  The
  symmetry of the coefficient should probably be compatible with the
  symmetric of the elasticity, although &oof2; does not enforce this
  restriction.  &materials; containing an anisotropic thermal
  expansion &property; must also contain an <link
