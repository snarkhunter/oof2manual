  <para>
    <command>ExpandNodeSelection</command> selects nodes by selecting
    the neighbors of the currently selected &nodes;.  The
    <varname>criterion</varname> parameter determines exactly which
    other &nodes; are considered to be neighbors.  For illustrations,
    see the reference pages for the subclasses of <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-ExpandCriterion"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    Expanding the &node; selection is useful when applying &skel;
    <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifier</link>
    to a portion of a &skel;.  For example, to improve the resolution
    of a boundary in a &micro;, it's convenient to <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Anneal"/> the &nodes; that are close to
    the boundary.  To do this, select the &nodes; on the boundary,
    expand the selection, and then <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Anneal"/> the selected &nodes;.
