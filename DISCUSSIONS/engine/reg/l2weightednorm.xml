  <para>
    <classname>WeightedL2ErrorNorm</classname> is one way of computing
    the error in an element when using the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-ZZ_Estimator"/> to drive finite element
    mesh <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-AdaptiveMeshRefine">adaptation</link>.
    <classname>WeightedL2ErrorNorm</classname> is just like <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-L2ErrorNorm"/>, except that the integral
    for each element is multiplied by a weight factor that elements
    with low stress.
