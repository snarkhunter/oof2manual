<para>
  Select a contiguous set of pixels by sweeping the mouse over them.
  The mouse acts like a paintbrush with a size and shape given by the
  <varname>style</varname> parameter.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>source</varname> parameter is the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to a &micro; or &image;.
  If it's an &image;, the selection is made in the &micro; in which
  the &image; resides.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>points</varname> parameter is a <link
  linkend="Object-list">Python list</link> of <link
  linkend="Object-Point"><classname>Points</classname></link> in the
  &micro;.  The selected pixels will be those that are under the brush
  when the brush is centered on one of the specified
  <varname>points</varname> or on any point on the line segments
  joining them.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname> parameters
  govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>)
  the shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click
  that initiated this command.

        (a) Click and drag to select pixels, as partially illustrated
        by the yellow curve.  The brush shape is drawn around the
        mouse cursor. In this example it's a <xref
        linkend="RegisteredClass-GfxCircleBrush"/> with
        <code>radius=3.0</code>.  The cursor's path is drawn as well.
        (The &micro; is 92&times;91, in physical units).
