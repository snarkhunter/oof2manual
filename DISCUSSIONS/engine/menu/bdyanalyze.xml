<para>
  The <command>Boundary_Analysis</command> menu contains commands that
  perform operation on <link
  linkend="Section-Output"><classname>Outputs</classname></link> on
  the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-SkeletonBoundaries">boundaries</link> of a
  &mesh;, which are implicitly defined by its &skel; boundaries.
</para>
<para>
  The boundary analysis commands compute quantities that can be useful
  to know when finding the effective modulus of a material, namely the
  average of a &field; over a boundary and the integral of a &flux;.
  &oof2; does not actually compute effective moduli, because that
  calculation depends on certain assumptions that it cannot make.
