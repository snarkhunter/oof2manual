  <para>
    At any point in an &oof2; session, one can save a log file of all
    of the commands that have been executed.  The file is a Python
    <link linkend="Section-Concepts-FileFormats-Script">script</link>.
    Subsequently loading the file with <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.File.Load.Script"/> or with the <link
    linkend="CommandLineArg-script"><userinput>--script</userinput></link>
    command line argument will recreate the &oof2; session.
    <note>
      <para>
	Loading a saved script may not <emphasis>exactly</emphasis>
	reproduce an &oof2; session if the script contains commands
	that use the random number generator, such as many of the
	<link
	linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier"><classname>Skeleton</classname>
	modification</link> methods.  The randomness of the random
	number generator can be made predictable (on a given computer)
	by always using the <link
	linkend="CommandLineArg-seed"><userinput>--seed</userinput></link>
	command line argument, but of course then the numbers aren't
	truly random.

    <note>
      <para>
	Saving and reloading a log file is an inefficient way of
	restoring an &oof2; session, because each command is
	re-executed when the file is loaded.  It is more efficient to
	use the other commands in the <xref
	linkend="MenuItem-OOF.File.Save"/> menu to save the
	<emphasis>objects</emphasis> (&micros;, &skels;, and &meshes;)
	that &oof2; creates.
