<para>
  This command is deprecated but will still work in scripts. New
  scripts should use <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Subproblem.Field.Activate"/> instead.
</para>
<para>
  Activating a &field; on a &mesh; means that the components of the
  &field; will be found when the &mesh; is <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Solve">solved</link>, if the &field;
  appears in any <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Equation.Activate">active</link>
  &equations;.
</para>
<para>
  Only &fields; that have been <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Field.Define">defined</link> may be
  activated.  Fields that have been defined but
  <emphasis>not</emphasis> activated are passive fields: they may
  still be used in active &equations;, but they are treated as
  constants instead of as variables.
