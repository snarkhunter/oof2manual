  <para>
    <classname>AutomaticRationalization</classname> is used as the
    value of the <varname>method</varname> parameter in the <xref
      linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalize"/> &skel; <link
      linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifier</link>.  It
    applies each of the <link
      linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalizer">rationalization
      tools</link> to every &elem; in the set of &elems; specified by
    the <varname>targets</varname> parameter for <xref

    <para>
      Automatic <link
      linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalize">rationalizing</link> works
      best with a focus group of badly-shaped elements -- since it
      tries every possible method on each element, it's a very costly
      procedure for a large group of target elements.  See <xref
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ElementSelection.Select_by_Shape_Energy"/>
      for the selection of badly-shaped elements.
