  <para>
    When using the GUI, the <command>AutoSend</command> controls
    whether or not newly edited layers are sent automatically when
    editing is complete.  By default, <command>AutoSend</command> is
    turned on.  When it's on, explicit <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Send"><command>Send</command></link>
    commands are needed only when the displayed object is <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.DisplayedObject">changed</link>,
    or when &layers; are <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Delete_Method">deleted</link>.
    In scripts and in text mode, explicit <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Send"><command>Send</command></link>
    commands are always required, and <command>AutoSend</command> is
    ignored.
