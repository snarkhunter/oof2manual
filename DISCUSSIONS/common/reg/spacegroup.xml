  The space group number is an integer between 1 and 230, inclusive.

  Many different space groups can correspond to the same point group.
  &oof2; only cares about point groups, not space groups, but it
  allows you to enter space groups because some EBSD data files
  contain space group numbers.  When &oof2; converts a point group
  name to a space group number, it uses the smallest space group
  number for that point group.
