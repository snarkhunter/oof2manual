    Floating boundary conditions set the values of &fields; on a
    boundary, up to an unspecified offset.  &field; values on the
    boundary can change, but &field; differences between two points on
    the boundary will stay fixed.  A separate boundary condition must
    be established for each component of a &field; that is to be
    constrained.  Floating boundary conditions may be applied to both
    <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge">Edge</link> and
    <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Point">Point</link>
    boundaries.
  </para>
  <para>
    The parameters for floating boundary conditions are the same as
    those for <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-DirichletBC">Dirichlet</link> boundary
    conditions.  See that discussion for details.
