<para>
  <classname>IsotropicRank4TensorCij</classname> is a rank 4 tensor
  with isotropic symmetry.  It is parametrized by its two
  independent components, <varname>c11</varname> and
  <varname>c12</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  The dialog box for setting the value of the tensor is shown in
  <xref linkend="Figure-isocij"/>.  Although the tensor only has two
  independent components, there are three different numbers that can
  be changed in the dialog: C<subscript>11</subscript>,
  C<subscript>12</subscript>, and C<subscript>44</subscript>.
  Changing any of them will update the others.  If
  C<subscript>11</subscript> or C<subscript>12</subscript> is changed,
  a new C<subscript>44</subscript> will be computed when the user hits
  return or clicks elsewhere.  If C<subscript>44</subscript> is
  changed, C<subscript>12</subscript> will be recomputed.
</para>
