<para>
  The <command>CLASS</command> command in the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.UndoBuffer_Size"/> menu sets the size
  of the history buffer for <classname>CLASS</classname> objects.
  When an object is modified, the previous <varname>size</varname>
  objects are preserved in the buffer, which allows the
  <command>Undo</command> and <command>Redo</command> commands to
  work.  Using a large <varname>size</varname> allows more operations
  to be undone, but uses more memory.
</para>
<warning>
  <para>
    Reducing the buffer size can cause data loss.
