<para>
  Select a contiguous set of pixels by dragging out an ellipse with
  the mouse.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>source</varname> parameter is the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to a &micro; or
  &image;.  If it's an &image;, the selection is made in the &micro;
  in which the &image; resides.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>points</varname> parameter is a <link
  linkend="Object-list">Python list</link> of <link
  linkend="Object-Point"><classname>Points</classname></link> in the
  &micro;, indicating the mouse motion.  The first and last points
  in the list are the diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle that
  encloses the ellipse.  Any other points in the list are ignored.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname> parameters
  govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>)
  the shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click
  that initiated this command.
