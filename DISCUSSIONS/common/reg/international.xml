<para>
  Specify lattice symmetry using the International or Hermann-Mauguin
  names for point groups, as listed in the <ulink
  url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_point_group%23The_correspondence_between_different_notations"
  role="external">table of point groups</ulink> at Wikipedia.  &oof2;
  uses the short Hermann-Mauguin notation.
</para>
<para>
  In &oof2; the point group names are simple character strings and
  don't include the overbars in some of the full names.  If a number
  is supposed to have a bar over it, in &oof2; it is preceded by a
  minus sign.  For example, the tetragonal point group
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \(\bar{4}2m\)
    </alt>
  </inlineequation>
  becomes <varname>-42m</varname> in &oof2;.
