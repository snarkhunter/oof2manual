    This command sets the color scheme and widget shapes used in the
    GUI.  OOF2 uses the <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org"
    role="external"><application>gtk+</application></ulink> graphics
    toolkit from Gnome.  Gnome themes may be downloaded from <ulink
    url="http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2/" role="external"/>.  &oof2;
    will look for themes in the system themes directory and in the
    <filename>.themes</filename> subdirectory in the your home
    directory.
  </para>
  <para>
    To automatically set the theme for all &oof2; sessions,
    put this command in the file
    <filename>.oof2rc</filename> in your home directory, for example:
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
      OOF.Settings.Theme(theme="Metal")
    </literallayout>
    Alternatively, it's possible to set the theme for
    <emphasis>all</emphasis> <application>gtk+</application> programs
    by putting a line like this:
    <literallayout>
      gtk-theme-name = "Metal"
    </literallayout>
    in the <filename>.gtkrc-2.0</filename> file in your home
    directory.
