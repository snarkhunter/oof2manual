<para>
  This command creates a second &micro; based on an &image; already
  loaded in another &micro;.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>name</varname> parameter is the name of the new
  &micro;.  If set to <link
  linkend="Object-automatic"><constant>automatic</constant></link> the
  &micro; name will be taken from the &image; name.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>image</varname> parameter must be a <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to an existing &image;
  object.
</para>
<para>
  The new &micro; will have the same pixel size as the given
  <varname>image</varname>.  Its physical size will be the same as the
  size of the &micro; containing <varname>image</varname> old &micro;
  if both <varname>width</varname> and <varname>height</varname> are
  <constant>automatic</constant>.  If one dimension is numeric and the
  other is <constant>automatic</constant>, the &micro; will be scaled
  to that new size while preserving the aspect ratio of the original
  &micro;.  If both dimensions are numeric, the new &micro; might have
  a different aspect ratio from the original.
</para>
<para>
  Other than the &image; and size, the new &micro; will not inherit
  any other data from the original.  It will have no &materials;,
  <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Pixel_Group"> pixel
  groups</link>, or &skels;.
