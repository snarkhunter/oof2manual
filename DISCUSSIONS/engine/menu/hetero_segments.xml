	    (a) A &skel; containing some heterogeneous &sgmts;.  The
	    pixels have been grouped by <link
	    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.AutoGroup">color</link>, so
	    &sgmts; straddling two colors are inhomogeneous.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        (b) After selecting with <code>threshold=0.9</code>, &sgmts;
        that are less than 90% homogeneous have been selected and are
        marked by heavy green lines.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        (c) The same, but with <code>threshold=0.5</code>.  Only one
        segment is selected.  (Unless a segment crosses three or more
        pixel categories, it is impossible for its homogeneity to be
        less than 0.5.)
