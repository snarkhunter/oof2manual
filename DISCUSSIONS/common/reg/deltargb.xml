  <para>
    <classname>DeltaRGB</classname> is a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-ColorDifference"/> object, used as a
    parameter when selecting pixels in &images;.  It specifies the
    difference between two colors by the differences between their
    red, green, and blue components, taken separately.  The difference
    between two colors is less than <classname>DeltaRGB</classname> if
    the absolute value of the differences in their red, green, and
    blue components are less than <varname>delta_red</varname>,
    <varname>delta_green</varname>, and <varname>delta_blue</varname>,
    respectively.  The <varname>deltas</varname> are floating point
    numbers between 0 and 1, inclusive, where 0 indicates no intensity
    difference and 1 indicates the maximum possible difference.
