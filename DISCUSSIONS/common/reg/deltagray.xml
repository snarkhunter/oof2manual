  <para>
    <classname>DeltaGray</classname> is a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-ColorDifference"/> object, used as a
    parameter when selecting pixels in &images;.  It specifies the
    difference between two colors by converting them to grayscale, and
    comparing the results.  The difference between two colors is less
    than <classname>DeltaGray</classname> if the absolute value of the
    difference of the average of their red, green, and blue components
    is less than <varname>delta_gray</varname>.
    <varname>delta_gray</varname> is a floating point number between 0
    and 1 inclusive, where 0 indicates no intensity difference, and 1
    indicates the maximum possible difference.
