<para>
  Select &skel; &elems; whose &material; is named by the
  <varname>material</varname> parameter. An &elem;'s &material; is
  the &material; assigned to the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">dominant
  pixel</link> in the set of &micro; pixels underlying the &elem;.
</para>
<para>
  In the GUI, the pull down menu for the <varname>material</varname>
  parameter includes all of the defined &materials; as well as the
  strings <userinput>&lt;Any&gt;</userinput> and
  <userinput>&lt;None&gt;</userinput>.  If <varname>material</varname>
  is set to <userinput>'&lt;None&gt;'</userinput>, then &elems; with
  no &material; will be selected.  This can happen only if there are
  pixels in the &micro; with no assigned &material;.  If
  <varname>material</varname> is <userinput>'&lt;Any&gt;'</userinput>,
  then &elems; with any &material; will be selected.  Choosing &elems;
  with <userinput>'&lt;Any&gt;'</userinput> is exactly like choosing
  them with <userinput>'&lt;None&gt;'</userinput> and then <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ElementSelection.Invert"><command>Invert</command></link>ing
  the selection.
