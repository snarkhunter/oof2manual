<para>
  Subclasses of <classname>BasicStepDriver</classname> describe how to
  take time steps when using <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/>.  Choose <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicStaticDriver"/> to solve
  non-time-dependent problems, and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicAdaptiveDriver"/> or <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicUniformDriver"/> to solve time
  dependent problems.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>BasicStepDriver</classname> and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-StepDriver"/> have the same types of
