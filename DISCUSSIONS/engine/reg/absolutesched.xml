<para>
  Using an <classname>AbsoluteOutputSchedule</classname> in <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Schedule.Set"/> means
  that the times produced by the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> are interpreted as absolute
  times, and do not depend on the starting time of the current
  computation.
</para>
<para>
  For example, if the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> is
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Periodic"/> with
  <varname>delay</varname>=0 and <varname>interval</varname>=0.1, the
  output times will be multiples of 0.1, even if the initial time for
  the simulation was 0.05.
</para>
<para>
  Compare to <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-RelativeOutputSchedule"/>.
