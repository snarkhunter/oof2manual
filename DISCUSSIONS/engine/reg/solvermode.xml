<para>
  <classname>SolverMode</classname> subclasses are used to set the
  <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solving">solution method</link>
  for a &subproblem; in the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Subproblem.Set_Solver"/> command.  The two
  modes differ in the amount of detail that the user must provide.  In
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/>, &oof2; makes most
  decisions automatically.  In <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/>, all decisions are
  left up to the user.  In both cases, the subclass parameters
  determine the time stepping method (or if there is to be any time
  stepping at all) and the matrix equation solution technique.
