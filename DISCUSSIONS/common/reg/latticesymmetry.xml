<para>
  <classname>LatticeSymmetry</classname> parameters are used in a few
  cases in which it's necessary to specify the full point group of the
  crystal lattice.  For example, when providing an elastic modulus, it
  may be sufficient to say that a material is cubic, but when deciding
  whether two Euler angles represent equivalent orientations, it may
  be necessary to know which cubic point group the material belongs to.

<para>
  The subclasses of <classname>LatticeSymmetry</classname> allow you
  to specify the symmetry in a variety of popular styles.  Any
  of the styles can be used to represent any symmetry.
