<para>
  <classname>GrayData8</classname> objects are used to store &image;
  pixels in &oof2; data files.  The <varname>grayvalues</varname>
  argument contains a <link linkend='Object-list'>Python list</link>
  of unsigned short integers, representing the gray values of the
  pixels, starting at the top left of the image and proceeding by
  rows.  That is, the pixels are written in the order described by
  the following pseudocode:
  <literallayout>
loop over rows from top to bottom:
  loop over columns from left to right:
    write gray </literallayout>
</para>
<para>
  The origin of the name <classname>GrayData8</classname> is lost in
  the mists of time.  It should probably be
  <classname>GrayData16</classname>.  Since it's only used internally
  in data files, it's not worth changing it.
