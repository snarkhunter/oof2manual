  Shrink the current <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-PixelSelection">pixel
  selection</link> in the &micro; called
  <varname>microstructure</varname> by deselecting all pixels within a
  distance <varname>radius</varname> of a currently unselected pixel.
  The radius is given in units of the &micro; pixel size.

  This is the opposite of <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection.Expand"/>, in a sense, but it

  selection and then expanding it by the same amount does not in
  general return to the original selection.
