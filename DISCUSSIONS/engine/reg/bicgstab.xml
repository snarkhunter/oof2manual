  linear matrix equations in <xref

<para>
  <classname>BiCGStab</classname> is an iterative method, meaning that
  it creates an approximate solution and improves it on each
  iteration.  The iteration will cease when the relative error of the
  solution is less than the given <varname>tolerance</varname>.  The
  solver will stop and report an error if the tolerance isn't
  satisfied within <varname>max_iterations</varname> iterations.

<para>
  The <varname>preconditioner</varname> parameter specifies which
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Preconditioner"/> to use, if any.

  speed the convergence of iterative methods by replacing the original
  matrix by something closer to the identity matrix.
