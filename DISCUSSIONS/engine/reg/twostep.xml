<para>
  <classname>TwoStep</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-QCTimeStepper"/>, used to take time steps
  with a measurable error estimate when <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solving">solving</link> a
  time-dependent &mesh;.  It appears as the <varname>stepper</varname>
  argument to <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AdaptiveDriver"/> in
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/>.  In <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/>, it's used
  automatically.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>TwoStep</classname> works by stepping over the interval
  from time <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(t_0\)</alt></inlineequation> to time
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(t_1\)</alt></inlineequation>
  twice, once in a single step of size <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\Delta t=t_1-t_0\)</alt></inlineequation> and once in
  two steps of size <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\Delta
  t/2\)</alt></inlineequation>.  The difference between the results is
  a measure of the error incurred by the stepping method.
  <varname>singlestep</varname> sets the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-TimeStepper"/> for the individual steps.
</para>
<para>
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AdaptiveDriver"/> uses its <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-StepErrorScaling"/> method to compare its
  <varname>tolerance</varname> to the error estimate from
  <classname>TwoStep</classname>, and thence to decide whether or not
  a time step is acceptable or needs to be repeated.
