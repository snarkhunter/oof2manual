<para>
  The <classname>SplitQuads</classname> &skel; <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifier</link> improves
  the <xref linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homog_Energy"/> of a
  quadrilateral &elem; by splitting it along a diagonal into two
  triangles.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>targets</varname> parameter specifies which &elems; to
  examine as possible candidates for splitting.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>criterion</varname> parameter determines the conditions
  under which splits will be accepted or rejected.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>split_how</varname> parameter determines how the
  diagonal is chosen for each split.  When set to <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-GeographicQ2T"/>, the diagonal is chosen
  according to the dominant categories of the neighboring &elems;.
  When set to <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-TrialAndErrorQ2T"/>, both
  diagonals are tried and the better one is chosen according to the
  given <varname>criterion</varname>.
</para>

<para>
  The left-hand image in <xref linkend="Figure-split"/> is a
  portion of a &skel; with two &elems; that can be split.  Such
  &elems; are often created by <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SnapNodes"/>, if it has moved opposing
  &nodes; to the same pixel boundary.  The heterogeneous elements
  (highlighted with thick lines) are surrounded by
  <emphasis>two</emphasis> types of elements (two
  <emphasis>blue</emphasis> elements and two
  <emphasis>white</emphasis> elements for each case) and the material
  boundary is closely following their diagonals.  The right-hand image
  is the result of applying <classname>SplitQuads</classname> with
  <code>split_how=GeographicQ2T()</code>.
