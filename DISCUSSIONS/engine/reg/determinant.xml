<para>
  <classname>Determinant</classname> is one of the <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Invariant"><classname>Invariants</classname></link>
  of a symmetric three dimensional rank 2 tensor quantity that can be
  computed by the &oof2; <link
  linkend="Section-Output"><classname>Outputs</classname></link>.
</para>
<note>
  <para>
    &oof2; computes the three dimensional determinant, so if you do a
    plane-stress problem, the determinant of the stress will be zero.
    However, the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SecondInvariant"/>
    will be the determinant of the in-plane part of the stress.
