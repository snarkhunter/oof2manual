<para>
  Compute a vector function of spatial coordinates
  <varname>x</varname> and <varname>y</varname> on a &mesh;.
</para>
<para>
  The function is evaluated by the Python interpreter, so it can
  contain any legal Python expressions.  Any variables defined in the
  &oof2; <link linkend="Section-Windows-Console">Console</link> window
  can be used in the function.  For example, if you type
  <blockquote>
    <simpara> <userinput>slope=3</userinput> </simpara>
  </blockquote>
  in the <link linkend="Section-Windows-Console">Console</link>, you can enter
  <blockquote>
    <simpara><userinput>slope*x + y</userinput></simpara>
  </blockquote>
  for <varname>fx</varname> or <varname>fy</varname>.  The Python
  math library is also available.  You could set
  <varname>fx</varname> to
  <blockquote>
    <simpara><userinput>sin(x*y/100)</userinput></simpara>
  </blockquote>
  for example.
