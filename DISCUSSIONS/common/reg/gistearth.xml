  translate numbers into colors, for use in contour plots.
  <classname>GistEarth</classname> uses a geographically inspired
  color sequence, from dark blue at the bottom, representing water,
  through green, beige, and finally white at the top, representing
  snow-covered mountains.  The resulting contour plots resemble
  topographical maps.  The name comes from the GIST software for
  viewing GIS data, which popularized this scheme.
