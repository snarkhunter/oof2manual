  <para>
    The <varname>source</varname> parameter is the <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to a &micro; or
    &image;.  If it's an &image;, the selection is made in the &micro;
    in which the &image; resides.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>points</varname> parameter is a <link
    linkend="Object-list">Python list</link> of <link
    linkend="Object-Point"><classname>Points</classname></link> in
    the &micro;.  When the command is invoked by the GUI, it's
    possible that the list may contain more than one point if the
    mouse was moving during the click.  Only the first point in the
    list is used.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
    parameters govern how the current selection
    (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
    this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
    already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
    linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
    (<userinput>1</userinput>) or not (<userinput>0</userinput>) the
    shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
    initiated this command.

	      The previous selection is retained, and the current
	      selection is added to it. That is, the new selection is
	      the union of the previous and current selections.

	      The previous selection is toggled at all members of the
	      current selection.  That is, all members of the new
	      selection are in the previous or current selections, but
	      not both.

	      Members of the current selection are kept only if they
	      were also members of the previous selection. That is,
	      the new selection is the intersection of the previous
	      and current selections.
