  This menu contains commands for creating, copying, renaming, and
  deleting boundary conditions in &meshes;.
</para>
<para>
  &oof2; provides five kinds of boundary conditions:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
	  <simpara>
	    <link linkend="RegisteredClass-DirichletBC">Dirichlet</link>
	    boundary conditions set the values of &field; components.
	  </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
	  <simpara>
	    <link linkend="RegisteredClass-NeumannBC">Neumann</link>
	    boundary conditions set the values of &flux; components.
	  </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
	  <simpara>
	    <link linkend="RegisteredClass-FloatBC">Floating</link>
	    boundary conditions set the values of &field; components, but
	    only up to an unspecified offset.
	  </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
	  <link linkend="RegisteredClass-ForceBC">Generalized
	  Force</link> boundary conditions set the forces on a set of
	  nodes.
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
	  <link linkend="RegisteredClass-PeriodicBC">Periodic</link> boundary
	  conditions set the values of &field; components for two periodic edge
	  boundaries to be equal.
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  See the discussions of each type of condition in the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BC"/> section.
</para>
<para>
  Boundary conditions can be applied to a &mesh; only at <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundaries</link>
  that have been defined in the &skel; from which the &mesh; was
  derived.  The &fields; and &equations; referred to in the boundary
  conditions need to be <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Field-Active">active</link>.
