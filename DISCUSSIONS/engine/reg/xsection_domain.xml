  <para>
    <classname>Domain</classname> objects are part of the
    post-solution <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework, in
    which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
    <classname>Domain</classname> is the subset of the &mesh; to which
    the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> is
    applied.  When the domain is set to
    <classname>CrossSectionDomain</classname>, the sampling points are
    distributed along a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshCrossSection"/>, or a one-dimensional
    cut through the &mesh;.
  </para>
  <para>
    <classname>CrossSectionDomain</classname> domains support <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> methods in the
    <link linkend="Sampling-line">line</link> and <link
    linkend="Sampling-bentline">bent line</link> categories.
