    Hide, but do not delete, a graphics &layer;.

  <para>
    In GUI mode, this command operates on the currently <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Select">selected</link>
    &layer;.  In text mode and in scripts, the &layer; is specified by
    its position <varname>n</varname> in the window's layer list.  The
    <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Settings.List_All_Layers">unlisted</link>
    layers must be counted when computing <varname>n</varname>.  This
    command isn't very friendly in scripts, because it can be hard to
    determine the parameter <varname>n</varname>.
