<para>
  This command sets the size of the fixed width font to be used in
  text displays in the GUI, such as the <link
  linkend="Section-Windows-Console">Console</link> and <link
  linkend="Section-Windows-Messages">Messages</link> windows.  These
  windows look best in a fixed-width font.
</para>
<para>
  It is currently not possible to set the font itself except
  (possibly) by changing the <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.Theme">Gtk theme</link>.
</para>
<para>
  To automatically set the font for all &oof2; sessions,
  put this command in the file

  <literallayout class="monospaced">
    OOF.Settings.Font.Fixed(fontsize=12)
  </literallayout>
