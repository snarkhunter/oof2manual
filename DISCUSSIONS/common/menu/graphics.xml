<para>
  Any &oof2; commands that either affect what's displayed in a <link
  linkend='Chapter-Graphics'>Graphics window</link> or whose
  behavior depends on what's displayed in the window are kept in a
  menu called <command>OOF.Graphics_</command><varname>n</varname>,
  where <varname>n</varname> is the number of the Graphics window.
  All Graphics windows menus are the same, and in this manual
  they're all called <quote><command>Graphics_n</command></quote>.
