<para>
  Rewinding an <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/>
  means that the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Output</link>'s file will be cleared before any more data is added
  to it.  This happens even if the original file was opened for
  appending.
</para>
<para>
  It may be desirable to rewind output destinations when repeating a
  time evolution calculation.  If the destinatons are not rewound,
  data from the second calculation will be appended to data from the
  first.
</para>
<para>
  Only file-based <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/>s
  can be rewound.  This command has no effect on <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-GraphicsUpdate"/> or <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-MessageWindowStream"/>.
