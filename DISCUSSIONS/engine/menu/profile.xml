  <para>
    The Profiles menu contains commands for managing <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition-NamedProfile">named <classname>Profiles</classname></link>.
    Named <classname>Profiles</classname> can be saved and reused in
    multiple <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition">boundary
    conditions</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
    Creating named <classname>Profiles</classname> is optional. When
    creating boundary conditions, it's always possible to specify a
    <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-CoreProfile"/> directly, without
    first giving it a name.  The advantage of using a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-NamedProfile"/> instead is that they can
    be reused in different boundary conditions and in different
    &meshes;.
