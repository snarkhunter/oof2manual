  <para>
    &oof2; data files are composed of commands from the
    <guimenu>LoadData</guimenu> menu.  &oof2; writes the commands in
    the file when the data is <link
    linkend='MenuItem-OOF.File.Save'>saved</link>, and executes the
    commands when the file is <link
    linkend='MenuItem-OOF.File.Load'>loaded</link>.  The casual user
    will never need to know the details of these commands, but users
    who want to edit or write data files themselves will need to know
    how they work.
