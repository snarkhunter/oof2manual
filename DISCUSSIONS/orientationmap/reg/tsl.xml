    This interface between TSL files and &oof2; was created at the

  </footnote> EBSD devices.  There is no guarantee that it

  us as examples 10 or more years ago, and is not based on any formal

<para>
  The TSL data file is expected to look like this.  Items in bold are
  keywords that &oof2; expects to find. <footnote>
    <simpara>
      &oof2; isn't actually paying much attention to the keywords.  It
      assumes that they're in the order given, and it doesn't bother
      to check that <code>YCells</code> comes after
      <code>XCells</code>, for example.
    </simpara>
  </footnote>
  Words in angle
  brackets (like <code>&lt;this&gt;</code>) describe numbers that
  &oof2; that oof2 will read.
