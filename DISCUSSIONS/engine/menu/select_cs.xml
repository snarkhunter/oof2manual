  <para>
    <command>OOF.Mesh.Cross_Section.Select</command> marks a cross
    section in the given &mesh; as the currently selected cross
    section.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <link linkend="Section-Graphics-CrossSection">Mesh Cross
    Section toolbox</link> operates on the currently selected cross
    section, and the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshCrossSectionDisplay"/> can
    automatically display it.  However, unlike <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-PixelSelection">pixel</link>
    and <link linkend="Section-Graphics-SkeletonSelection">Skeleton
    selections</link>, no menu commands operate directly on the
    selected cross section.  This is because all cross sections have
    <link linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Cross_Section.New">names</link>,
    so the menu commands can simply refer to them by name.
  </para>
  <para>
    New cross sections are automatically selected when they are created.
