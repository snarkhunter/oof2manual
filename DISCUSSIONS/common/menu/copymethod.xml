  <para>
    Copy a &layer; within the &layerset; currently being edited in the
    &layereditor;.  The &layer; and its <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-DisplayMethod"/> are duplicated, and the
    new &layer; is selected in the &layereditor;.
  </para>
  <para>
    When using the GUI it's often convenient to copy a &layer; and
    then modify it.  This generates a <command>Copy_Method</command>
    command followed by a <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Replace_Method"><command>Replace_Method</command></link>
    command.  In scripts this is sort of silly -- a single <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Add_Method"><command>Add_Method</command></link>
    command would suffice.  However, &oof2; log files have to follow
    the sequence of events from the GUI, so they will contain a
    <command>Copy_Method</command>/<command>Replace_Method</command> pair.
