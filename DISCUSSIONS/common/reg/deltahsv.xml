  <para>
    <classname>DeltaHSV</classname> is a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-ColorDifference"/> object, used as a
    parameter when selecting pixels in &images;.  It specifies the
    difference between two colors by comparing their <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-HSVColor">HSV</link> representations.
    The difference between two colors is less than
    <classname>DeltaHSV</classname> if the absolute value of the
    differences of their hues, saturations, and values are less than
    <varname>delta_hue</varname>, <varname>delta_saturation</varname>,
    and <varname>delta_value</varname>, respectively.
    <varname>delta_hue</varname> and
    <varname>delta_saturation</varname> are dimensionless floating
    point numbers between 0 and 1, since hue and saturatation must be
    between 0 and 1.  A color <varname>value</varname> is given by an
    angle, so <varname>delta_value</varname> is in degrees.  The
    absolute difference between two angles is always taken to be the
    shorter distance around the unit circle.
