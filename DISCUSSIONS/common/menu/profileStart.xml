THE PROFILE MENU IS COMMENTED OUT IN MAINMENU.PY SO THIS FILE IS NOT USED

<para>
  <emphasis>Profiling</emphasis> is the process of measuring how
  slow a program is.  The &oof2; profiler measures time spent in
  Python routines.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>filename</varname> is the name of a file where the
  profiling data will be stored.  This data is not in a human
  readable form.  After profiling is complete, view the file with
  the <filename>gfxprof.py</filename> python script, which may be
  found in the <filename>SRC/common/EXTRA</filename> subdirectory of
  the &oof2; source code.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>fudge</varname> is a measure of how much time is spent in
  the internal workings of the profiling machinery, rather than in
  the code that's being profiled.  The correct value varies from
  computer to computer.  Use <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Help.Debug.Profile.FudgeFinder"/> to estimate the
  value.
</para>
<para>
  The &oof2; profiling code is based on the Python profiler.  When
  the &oof2; profiler was written, the Python profiler did not
  handle excepctions correctly.  The &oof2; profiler measures
  elapsed time, not cpu time, on the theory that elapsed time is
  what really matters, and because the granlarity on cpu time
  measurements is too coarse.
