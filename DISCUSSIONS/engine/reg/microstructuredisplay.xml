  <para>
    The <classname>MicrostructureMaterialDisplay</classname> draws
    each pixel in a &micro; with the color of the &material; assigned
    to it.  If the assigned <classname>Material</classname> has no
    <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Property">Color property</link>,
    then the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-Color">Color</link> given
    by <varname>no_color</varname> is used.  If the pixel doesn't have
    a <classname>Material</classname>, then the
    <varname>no_material</varname> color is used.
