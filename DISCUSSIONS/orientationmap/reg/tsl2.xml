<para>
  This <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-OrientMapReader"/> reads data
  files produced by TSL (now ESAX)<footnote>
  <simpara>
    This interface between TSL files and &oof2; was created at the
    request of &oof2; users and does not represent an endorsement of
    TSL or ESAX by NIST.
  </simpara>
  </footnote> EBSD devices.  There is no guarantee that it is up to
  date.  It was written to read files that were provided to us as
  examples 10 or more years ago, and is not based on any formal file
  specification.  The <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-TSLreader"/>
  reader is based on an older example file.  If the
  <classname>TSL</classname> readers do not work, try using <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-GenericReader"/> instead.
</para>
<para>
  &oof2; expects the data file to start with some number of header
  lines that begin with <code>#</code>.  The content of these lines
  is ignored, except that if one of them begins with <code># GRID:
  HexGrid</code> the data will be assumed to lie on a hexagonal grid.
</para>
<para>
  After the header comes a table of data, with one line for each data
  point (pixel).  There must be at least 5 columns of data. The first
  three are <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Bunge"/> angles, and the
  next two are x and y coordinates.  &oof2; ignores any additional
  columns, except for the 8<superscript>th</superscript>, which can
  contain the name of a phase.  Pixels with the same phase name will
  be placed into a <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Pixel_Group">pixel
  group</link> with that name.
</para>
<para>
  &oof2; only works on rectangular grids pixels.  If the x values of
  the first two rows of data are not the same, or if
  <code>HexGrid</code> was found in the header, &oof2; assumes that
  the data file contains a hexagonal grid, and converts it to a
  rectangular grid by discarding every other row.
</para>

<para>
  The parameters <varname>flip_x</varname>, <varname>flip_y</varname>,
  and <varname>angle_offset</varname> provide some flexibility in
  interpreting the data file.
