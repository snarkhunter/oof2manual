  <classname>Liniger</classname> is a method for numerically
  integrating ordinary differential equations. It is a <link
  linkend="Section-GeneralizedEuler">generalized Euler</link> method
  with <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\theta=0.878\)</alt></inlineequation>.  This value
  minimizes the error over the whole time interval, at least in some
  simple cases, and tends to reduce unphysical oscillations in the
  solution.<footnote id="Footnote-ZTliniger">
