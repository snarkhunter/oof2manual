  Maps of different origins have different formats, which are
  generally poorly documented.  The vendor-specific subclasses defined
  here have worked at some time in the past, but are not guaranteed to
  work now.  The <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-GenericReader"/> lets
  you enter information about the format and hopefully will work on
  any file not covered by the specific readers.

    There are a lot of assumptions that go into reading a orientation
    map, and no real guarantee that the &oof2; authors have made the
    correct ones.  These assumptions include
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          The definition of the x and y axes.  Does y increase from
          top to bottom or from bottom to top on the screen?
        </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          The definition of the <link
          linkend="RegisteredClass-Orientation">Euler angles</link>.
          Which convention is being used?
        </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          The reference orientation in lab space.  Which orientation
          is the unrotated one?
        </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <simpara>
          The reference orientation in crystal space.  Which crystal
          axes are aligned with the unrotated x, y, and z axes?
        </simpara>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
    The safest procedure is to test your assumptions.  Create an
    artificial orientation map for a simple &micro; with anistropic
    &properties;, rotate the material by a known angle, apply boundary
    conditions or external forces, and make sure that the &micro;
    responds in the way that you expect it to.  If you get results
    that you don't expect, see if changing settings when reading the
    orientation map leads to better results.  In that case, the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-GenericReader"/> gives you the most
    options.

    If &oof2; can't read your orientation map file, please contact the
    developers at <email>oof_manager@nist.gov</email>.  We may
    be able to help.
