  <para>
    An <classname>XYZ</classname> object represents the orientation of
    a three dimensional object, assumed to be a crystal, in three
    dimensional space in terms of Euler angles conventionally denoted
    &phi;, &theta;, and &psi;.  In the <classname>XYZ</classname>
    convention, as implied by the name, these represent rotations
    successively about each axis.  Similarly to the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Abg"/> Euler angles, these define
    rotations which take the crystal basis vectors &ahat;, &bhat;, and
    &chat; into coincidence with the lab (or screen) basis vectors
    &xhat;, &yhat;, and &zhat;, respectively.  The first rotation,
    associated with &phi;, is about the initial crystalline &ahat;
    axis, the second by &theta; about the rotated crystalline &bhat;
    axis, and the third by &psi; about the doubly-rotated crystalline
    &chat; axis.
  </para>
  <para>
    This rotation scheme is one member of a family of rotation
    schemes, all of which differ only in the order in which the
    rotation axes are specified for the successive rotations
    associated with the Euler angles.  The <classname>XYZ</classname>
    convention is used in the aerodynamics community, where the angles
    correspond to the pitch, roll, and yaw of a vehicle.  In other
    conventions, such as <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-X"/>, when
    &theta; is small, then &phi; and &psi; have similar effects,
    which can be numerically inconvenient.  This convention avoids
    this feature. The nomenclature comes from the second edition of
    "Classical Mechanics" by H. Goldstein.
