  <para>
    <classname>LinearSolvers</classname> are applied by <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Driver"><classname>Driver</classname></link>s
    to solve the linear matrix equations that arise when <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Solver.Solve">solving</link> &equations; on a

  <para>
    The different types of <classname>LinearSolver</classname> are
    applicable to different types of matrix equations.  The reference
    page for each subclass gives some information about its
    applicability.  In particular, solution methods for
    <emphasis>symmetric</emphasis> matrices can take advantage of the
    symmetry to obtain a solution more efficiently.  &oof2; constructs
    symmetric matrices when possible, and only allows the symmetric
    solver (<xref linkend="RegisteredClass-CGSolver"/>) to be used in
    those cases.
  </para>
  <para>
    The matrices that arise in finite element calculations are
    generally <emphasis>sparse</emphasis>, meaning that many of their
    entries are zero.  Sparse matrices can be stored efficiently by
    only retaining the non-zero values.  The
    <emphasis>iterative</emphasis>
    <classname>LinearSolvers</classname> have the advantageous
    property of not requiring storage for the full matrix.  <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-DirectSolver"/> solvers, on the other hand,
    generate intermediate values at all matrix entries, and so their
    storage requirements are much larger.
