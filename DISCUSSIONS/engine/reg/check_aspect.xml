<para>
  Skinny &elems; (ones with a high aspect ratio) can cause poor
  finite element performance.  Refining a &skel; with the
  <varname>targets</varname> parameter of <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Refine"/> set to <classname>Aspect
  Ratio</classname> will subdivide the long sides of &elems; with
  high aspect ratios.
</para>
<para>
  The aspect ratio of a rectangle is its length divided by its width,
  or <foreignphrase>vice versa</foreignphrase>.  That definition
  doesn't work well for trianglar or non-rectangular quadrilateral
  &elems;.  The definition used in &oof2; is the square root of the
  ratio of the eigenvalues of the in-plane moment of inertia tensor of
  the element's corners.
</para>
<para>
  If corner <inlineequation><alt role="tex">n</alt></inlineequation>
  is at position
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \( \mathbf{x}^n \)
    </alt>
  </inlineequation>
  and the center of the element is
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \( \bar{\mathbf{x}} \),
    </alt>
  </inlineequation>
  then the moment of inertia tensor is
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[M_{ij} = \sum_n (\mathbf{x}^n_i-\bar{\mathbf{x}}_i)
      (\mathbf{x}^n_j-\bar{\mathbf{x}}_j)\]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  This definition reduces to the intuitive one if the element is
  rectangular, doesn't require any special handling if it is not, and
  can be computed more easily than it seems.
</para>
<para>
  The longest two edges of a quadrilateral
  &elem; whose aspect ratio is greater than
  <varname>threshold</varname> will be subdivided,
  if the longest two edges are on opposite sides of the element.
</para>
<para>
  The longest two edges of a triangular &elem; will be subdivided if
  the aspect ratio is greater than <varname>threshold</varname>, but
  only if the parameter <varname>only_quads</varname> is
  <varname>False</varname>.  If your goal is to eliminate high aspect
  elements, refining high aspect triangles is not useful &#x2014; it just
  creates new smaller triangles with the same high aspect ratio.  To
  remove skinny triangles from a &skel;, use the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalize"/> &skel; modifier.
</para>
<para>
  <xref linkend="Figure-aspect"/> shows a &skel; containing one skinny
  quadrilateral and one skinny triangle. <xref
  linkend="Figure-aspect-refined"/> shows the result of refining the
  elements.  Unlike <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-CheckHomogeneity"/>, which marks all the
  &sgmts; of its target &elems;,
  <classname>CheckAspectRatio</classname> marks only the long &sgmts;,
  so not all of the sides have been subdivided.

	    rules='Quick', alpha=1)</userinput>.  The quad was divided
	    into two elements with aspect ratios near 3, but the triangle
	    was turned into a quad with aspect ratio 8 and a new triangle
	    with aspect ratio 15, no better than the original triangle.
