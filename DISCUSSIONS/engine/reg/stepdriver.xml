<para>
  <classname>StepDriver</classname> objects are the
  <varname>time_stepper</varname> argument for <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/>.  They specify how
  multiple time step are to be combined into a full time evolution
  calculation.  In this context, <quote>multiple</quote> means zero or
  more, since one if the <classname>StepDrivers</classname> is <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-StaticDriver"/>, which solves static
  equations with no time steps.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>StepDriver</classname> and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicStepDriver"/> have the same types of
  subclasses, but the subclasses of <classname>StepDriver</classname>
  offer more customization via more complex parameters.
