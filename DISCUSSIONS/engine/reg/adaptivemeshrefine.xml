<para>
  <classname>AdaptiveMeshRefine</classname> marks &skel; &elems; for
  refinement if their counterparts in one of the &skel;'s &meshes;
  have a large error according to the given <foreignphrase>a
  posteriori</foreignphrase> error estimator.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>mesh</varname> parameter specifies the &mesh; on which
  the error estimator is to be applied.  For the estimates to be
  meaningful, the mesh must already have been <link

</para>
<para>
  <varname>estimator</varname> specifies which error estimator to use.
