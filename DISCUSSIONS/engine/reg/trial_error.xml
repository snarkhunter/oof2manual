  <para>
    <classname>TrialAndErrorQ2T</classname> is a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SplitQuadMethod"/>, used as the
    <varname>split_how</varname> parameter in when <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SplitQuads">splitting</link>
    quadrilateral &elems; into triangles.
  </para>
  <para>
    <classname>TrialAndErrorQ2T</classname> tentatively splits each
    quad along both of its diagonals.  The
    <varname>criterion</varname> given to the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SplitQuads"/> method will decide which of
    the results to accept, if any.
  </para>
  <para>
    When the &skel; is sufficiently refined so that all &elems; have
    the correct <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-PixelCategory">dominant
    pixel type</link>, using <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-GeographicQ2T"/> is usually more
    efficient than <classname>TrialAndErrorQ2T</classname>.
  </para>
