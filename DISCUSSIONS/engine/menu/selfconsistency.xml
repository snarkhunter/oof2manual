  multiple &subproblems;, &oof2; iterates over all of the
  &subproblems; at each time step, and stops iterating when it obtains
  results that are consistent with the previous iteration.  This

</para>
<para>
  Self-consistency of a &subproblem; is computed by constructing a
  vector from all of the &field; values on all of the &nodes;.
  Vectors are compared using values from before and after one
  iteration of the solver. If the norm of the difference of the two
  vectors is less than <varname>tolerance</varname> times the sum of
  the norms of the two vectors, the solutions are deemed to be
  consistent.
</para>
<para>
  The default <varname>tolerance</varname> is
  10<superscript>-6</superscript>, and the default
  <varname>max_iterations</varname> is 100.
