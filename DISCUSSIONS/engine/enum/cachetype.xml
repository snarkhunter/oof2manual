<para>
  <classname>CacheType</classname> values are used by <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SetMeshDataCacheType"/> and <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.Mesh_Defaults.Data_Cache_Type"/> to
  set the type of storage used for time step data in &meshes;.  A
  value of <userinput>Memory</userinput> means that the data will be
  stored in RAM, which is usually fast but limited in size.  A value
  of <userinput>Disk</userinput> means that the data will be stored in
  temporary files on disk, which is usually slower than RAM but not as
  limited in extent.
</para>
<para>
  When storing data on disk, &oof2; decides where to store the
  temporary files by looking for the name of a writable directory in
  the Unix environment variables <varname>OOFTMP</varname>,
  <varname>TMPDIR</varname>, <varname>TEMP</varname>, and
  <varname>TMP</varname>, in that order.  If none of those variables
  is set to the name of writable directory, &oof2; checks the
  directories <filename>/tmp</filename>,
  <filename>/var/tmp</filename>, and <filename>/usr/tmp</filename>, in
  that order.  If it <emphasis>still</emphasis> hasn't found a
  writable directory, it raises an error and suggests setting
  <varname>OOFTMP</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  The temporary files are given names starting with
  <userinput>oof2-cache</userinput>.  Normally the files are deleted
  when the &mesh; is deleted.  If the program ends abnormally, it's
  possible that the files will not be deleted automatically.
