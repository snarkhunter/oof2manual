  <para>
    A cross section is a path connecting two points in the mesh.  They
    can be created either in the <link
    linkend="Section-Graphics-CrossSection">cross section
    toolbox</link>, or on the <link
    linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis">analysis page</link>.  Mesh cross
    sections can be specified in <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-CrossSectionDomain">cross section
    domains</link>, and thus can have output values evaluated on them
    with various samplings.
