<para>
  Assigning a &material; to a &skel; &elemgroup; is a way of
  overriding the &material; assigned to pixels by <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Material.Assign"/>.  Normally an &elem;'s
  &material; is implicitly inherited from the &elem;'s <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">dominant
  pixel</link>.  If a &material; has been explicitly assigned to an
  &elemgroup; with <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ElementGroup.Assign_Material"/>, the
  explicitly assigned &material; will be used instead of the
  implicitly inherited &material; for all &elems; in the group.
</para>
<para>
  If an &elem; is in more than one &elemgroup;, the &elem;'s
  &material; is the last one assigned to any of the groups to which
  the &elem; belongs.  If a &material; is assigned to a group that
  already had an explicitly assigned &material;, the new &material;
  replaces the old one for all &elems; in the group.
</para>
<para>
  If an explicitly assigned &material; is removed with <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ElementGroup.Remove_Material"/>, the implicitly
  inherited &material; will be used.
</para>
<para>
  In the GUI, <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ElementGroup.Remove_Material"/> is invoked by
  the <guibutton>Remove</guibutton> button in the
  <guilabel>Material</guilabel> subpane of the <guilabel>Element group
  operations</guilabel> pane in the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-SkeletonSelection"><guilabel>Skeleton
  Selection Page</guilabel></link> when the page is in
  <guilabel>Elements</guilabel> mode.
