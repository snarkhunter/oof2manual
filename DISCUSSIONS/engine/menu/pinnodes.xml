<para>
  &nodes; that are <emphasis>pinned</emphasis> will not move during
  &skel; <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Modify">modification</link>
  operations.  Pinning &nodes; is one way of restricting the scope
  of future &skel; modifications.
</para>
<para>
  For example, some &nodes; may be already positioned on a material
  boundary, but the shapes of the &elems; in the interior of the
  material may need to be improved.  <xref
  linkend="Figure-pinexample"/> shows the results of <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Smooth">smoothing</link> a &skel; with
  and without pinned nodes.

	  <para>
	    (a) A portion of a &skel; that has been partially adapted to
	    the underlying &micro;.  Some &nodes; lie on the pixel
	    boundaries.
	  </para>
      <para>
        (b) The same &skel; after <link
        linkend="RegisteredClass-Smooth">smoothing</link> it for 5
        iterations with <code>alpha=0.3</code>.  The &nodes; have
        moved off of the boundary, decreasing the &skel;'s <link
        linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">homogeneity</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        (c) The same &skel;, smoothed in the same way, except that the
        boundary &nodes; were pinned before smoothing.  The &skel; is
        smoother away from the boundary, but the <link
        linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">homogeneity</link>
        has been preserved.

<para>
  In a graphics window, pinned &nodes; are marked with yellow dots.
  The size and color of the dots may be changed by editing the
  window's <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-PinnedNodesDisplay"/>.
</para>

<note>
  <para>
    Whether or not a &node; is pinned for the purpose of &skel;
    modifications has no bearing on whether or not it will move when a
    &mesh; is solved.  That depends on the boundary conditions and the
    value of the displacement &field;.  &node; pinning applies
    <emphasis>only</emphasis> to &skel; modifications.
