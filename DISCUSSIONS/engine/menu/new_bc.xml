  <para>
    <command>OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Conditions.New</command> creates a new
    named <link linkend="RegisteredClass-BC">boundary condition</link>
    in the given &mesh;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>name</varname> parameter is the name that will be
    assigned to the boundary condition.  All future operations on the
    boundary condition will refer to it by this name.  The name must
    be unique among all of the boundary condition names in the mesh.
    If it is not unique, then <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput> will be
    appended to it, where <userinput>x</userinput> is a suitable
    integer.  If the name is <xref linkend="Object-automatic"/>, a
    name will be assigned automatically.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>condition</varname> parameter is the new boundary
    condition to which the name is being applied.  It must be an
    instance of the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-BC"/> class. 
  </para>
