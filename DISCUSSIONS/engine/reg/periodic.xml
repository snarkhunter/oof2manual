  <para>
    Periodic boundary conditions set the values of a component of a &field; on a
    periodic pair of exterior <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge">edge</link> boundaries to
    be the same.  A separate boundary condition must be established for each
    component of a &field; that is to be periodic.  The value for the
    <varname>boundary</varname> parameter must be a string containing the names
    of two boundaries that constitute a periodic pair: the appropriate <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Periodicity">periodicity</link> option
    must have been chosen when the <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton">skeleton</link> was created in the <link
    linkend="Section-Tasks-Skeleton">skeleton task page</link> and the
    directions of the boundaries must be opposite.  By default, the left and
    right boundaries will constitute a valid pair if
    <varname>left_right_periodicity</varname> was chosen when the skeleton is
    created, as will the top and bottom boundaries, if
    <varname>top_bottom_periodity</varname> was chosen.  The GUI presents a pull
    down menu listing the legal strings, but users of the text interface will
    need to know the possible values.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>field</varname>, <varname>field_component</varname>,
    <varname>equation</varname>, and <varname>eqn_component</varname> parameters
    are the same as those for <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-DirichletBC">Dirichlet</link> boundary conditions.
    See that discussion for details.  Note that periodic boundary conditions do
    not have a <varname>profile</varname> parameter.

    <title>Example</title>
    <para>
	<literallayout class="monospaced">
    PeriodicBC(field=Displacement, field_component='y',
                equation=Force_Balance, eqn_component='y',
                boundary='left right')
	</literallayout>
      This constrains the y component of the
      <userinput>Displacement</userinput> along the right and left boundaries of
      the &mesh;, making the y component of the
      <userinput>Force_Balance</userinput> periodic in the horizontal direction. 
    </para>
