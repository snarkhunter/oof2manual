    <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Point">point</link>
    boundaries.  The <varname>linewidth</varname> and
    <varname>arrowsize</varname> arguments apply to edge boundaries,
    while the <varname>dotsize</varname> argument applies to point
    boundaries. All three arguments are in units of the screen pixel
