<para>
  Create a new &mesh; from a &skel;.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>name</varname> parameter provides a name for the new
  &mesh;.  It must be unique among all &meshes; in the given &skel;.
  If it is not unique, it will be made so by appending
  <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput> to it, where
  <userinput>x</userinput> is a suitable integer.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>element_types</varname> parameter specifies which <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Geometry">types of finite
  elements</link> to use in the mesh.  The list must contain the names
  of elements, and contain exactly one name for each type of element
  present in the &skel;.  That is, if the &skel; contains triangular
  elements, <varname>element_types</varname> must contain exactly one
  of the values listed in <xref linkend="Enum-Element3"/>.  If the
  &skel; contains both triangular and quadrilateral elements,
  <varname>element_types</varname> must contain one name from <xref
  linkend="Enum-Element3"/> and one from <xref
  linkend="Enum-Element4"/>.
</para>
<para>
  It is important to choose compatible triangular and quadrilateral
  &mesh; elements: nodes on the edges of a finite element must match
  up with nodes on its neighboring elements, so it's a mistake to mix
  6-noded triangles (with three nodes on an edge) with 4-noded quads
  (with only two nodes on an edge).  Diagrams of the element types are
  included in the documentation for <xref linkend="Enum-Element2"/>,
  <xref linkend="Enum-Element3"/>, and <xref linkend="Enum-Element4"/>.
