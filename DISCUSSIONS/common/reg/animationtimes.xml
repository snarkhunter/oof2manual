<para>
  <classname>AnimationTimes</classname> objects are used in <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.File.Animate"/> to determine which
  times to use when animating the display in a <link
  linkend="Chapter-Graphics">Graphics</link> window.
</para>
<para>
  The graphics window may be displaying one or more &meshes;, each of
  which stores data at a set of <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Time">times</link>.  The animation
  can display data at the times stored in one or all of the &meshes;,
  or it can use the full range of times and interpolate between them
  if necessary to get evenly spaced increments.
