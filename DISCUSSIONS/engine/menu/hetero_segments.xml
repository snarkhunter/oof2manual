	  <para>
	    (a) A &skel; containing some heterogeneous &sgmts;.  The
	    pixels have been grouped by <link
	    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.AutoGroup">color</link>, so
	    &sgmts; straddling two colors are inhomogeneous. (b) After
	    selecting with
	    <varname>threshold</varname>=<userinput>0.9</userinput>,
	    &sgmts; that are less than 90% homogeneous have been selected
	    and are marked by heavy green lines. (c) The same, but with
	    <varname>threshold</varname>=<userinput>0.5</userinput>.  Only
	    one segment is selected.  (Unless a segment crosses three or
	    more pixel categories, it is impossible for its homogeneity to
	    be less than 0.5.)
