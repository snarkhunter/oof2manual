<para>
  <classname>AdaptiveDriver</classname> objects are used as the
  <varname>time_stepper</varname> parameter in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/> when solving a
  time-dependent problem with <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solvers">adaptive time
  stepping</link>.  The <classname>AdaptiveDriver</classname> uses the
  given <varname>stepper</varname> to take single steps.  If the
  resulting error estimate is larger than the given
  <varname>tolerance</varname>, the step is rejected and is repeated
  with a smaller <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\Delta
  t\)</alt></inlineequation>.  If the error is
  <emphasis>less</emphasis> than the <varname>tolerance</varname>, the
  step size will be increased on the next step.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>initialstep</varname> is the step size to use at the
  beginning of the computation.  Once a computation is under way, the
  step size is determined by the error estimate from the previous
  step.
</para>
<para>
  If the error cannot be reduced below <varname>tolerance</varname>
  without using a step size below <varname>minstep</varname>, the
  computation will be aborted.  Often this means that the problem is
  badly posed, or that the <varname>errorscaling</varname> is in
  appropriate.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>errorscaling</varname> defines what is really meant by
  <quote>the error estimate is larger than the given
  <varname>tolerance</varname></quote>.  It determines how a set of
  errors in each &field; component value at each &node; is reduced to
  a single number that can be compared with the
  <varname>tolerance</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>AdaptiveDriver</classname> plays the same role in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/> that <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicAdaptiveDriver"/> plays in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/>.
