  <para>
    <classname>SampleSet</classname> objects are part of the
    post-solution <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework, in
    which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
    <classname>SampleSet</classname> determines how data is extracted
    from the sampling <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"/>.  When
    <varname>sampling</varname> is set to
    <classname>ElementSampleSet</classname>, data is integrated over
    the area of the &elems; in the <classname>Domain</classname>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <classname>ElementSampleSet</classname> belongs to the <link
    linkend="Sampling-element">element</link> SampleSet category.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>order</varname> parameter determines the Gaussian
    integration order.  Higher values will give more accurate results,
    at the cost of more computer time.
