<para>
  Each &image; in a &micro; has associated with it a buffer of
  modified versions of the &image;.  When the &image; is <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Modify">modified</link>, the new version
  is stored in the buffer.  The <command>Undo</command> command
  restores the next oldest version from the buffer, thereby undoing
  the most recent change.  The changed version is not destroyed, and
  can be recovered with <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Redo"/>.
</para>
<para>
  The &image; buffer has a limited size.  When it is full, the oldest
  versions of an &image; will be lost when new modifications are made.
  The size of the buffer can be changed with <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.UndoBuffer_Size.Image"/>.
