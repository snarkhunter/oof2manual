<para>
  Assigning &materials; to pixels is the climactic step in building
  a &micro;. The <varname>pixels</varname> argument is either
  the name of a <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Pixel_Group'>pixel
  group</link> in the &micro;, or one of the special <xref
  linkend="Object-Placeholder"/> objects
  <constant>all</constant> or <constant>selected</constant>.
  Choosing <constant>selected</constant> assigns the &material; to
  the pixels currently selected in the &micro;.
</para>
<para>
  Assigning a &material; to a pixel that already has a &material;
  simply overwrites the previous assignment.  There is no need to
  <link linkend='MenuItem-OOF.Material.Remove'>remove</link> the old
  &material; first.
</para>
<para>
  Assigning a &material; to a pixel does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
  store a copy of the information in the &material;.  The pixel always
  refers to the &material; object for the information it requires.  If
  the &material; is edited and its &properties; change, then the
  pixel's properties change.
