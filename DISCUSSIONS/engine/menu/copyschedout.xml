<para>
  Copy the given <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Output</link> from <varname>mesh</varname> to <varname>targetmesh</varname>.
  The linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/>, and its <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/>, <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduleType"/>, and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/> will all be copied.
  The target can be the same as the source.  If a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/> with the same name
  already exists in the target &mesh;, a new name will be created by
  appending <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput>, where
  <userinput>x</userinput> is an integer.
