  <para>
    <classname>Axis2HSV</classname> is an <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Angle2Color"/> that converts the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Axis"/> representation of an orientation
    into an <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-HSVColor"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The direction of the orientation's axis of rotation is represented
    by a declination &thgr; and an azimuth &phgr;.
    <classname>Axis2HSV</classname> maps the cosine of &thgr; into the
    HSV <varname>value</varname>, so that an orientation with &thgr;=0
    is bright and &thgr;=180 is black.  It maps the azimuth &phgr;
    into the HSV <varname>hue</varname>, so that &phgr;=&plusmn;180 is
    red and &phgr;=0 is cyan.
  </para>
  <para>
    The orientation's angle of rotation about the axis, &psgr;, is
    mapped to the HSV <varname>saturation</varname>, so that &psgr;=0
    is fully unsaturated (white, gray, or black), and &psgr;=1 is
    fully saturated.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that this isn't a great way to convert orientations to
    angles, because small changes in orientation can result in a large
    change in color, and black represents more than one orientation
    (all orientations with &psgr;=0 or &thgr;=180).
