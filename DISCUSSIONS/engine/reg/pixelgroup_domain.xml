  <para>
    <classname>Domain</classname> objects are part of the
    post-solution <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework, in
    which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
    <classname>Domain</classname> is the subset of the &mesh; to which
    the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> is
    applied.  When the domain is set to
    <classname>PixelGroup</classname>, the sampling points are derived
    from the positions of the pixels in the group.
  </para>
  <para>
    <classname>PixelGroup</classname> domains support <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> methods in the
    <link linkend="Sampling-point">point</link> and <link
    linkend="Sampling-pixel">pixel</link> categories.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>pixels</varname> parameter determines which pixels
    are used to define the domain.  It is either the name of a <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Pixel_Group">pixel
    group</link> or one of the <link
    linkend="Object-Placeholder">placeholder</link> objects,
    <userinput>selection</userinput> or
    <userinput>all</userinput>. <userinput>selection</userinput>
    indicates that the currently selected pixels should be used, and
    <userinput>all</userinput> indicates that all pixels in the
    &micro; should be used.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      When using a <classname>PixelGroup</classname> domain and
      sampling by <link
      linkend="RegisteredClass-PixelSampleSet">Pixels</link>, the
      data is evaluated at the center of each pixel.  When sampling on
      a grid, however, the grid is fit into the
      <classname>PixelGroup</classname>'s bounding box, that is, the
      smallest rectangle that contains all of the pixels.  This means
      that some of the sampling points might <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      lie on top of the specified pixels.
