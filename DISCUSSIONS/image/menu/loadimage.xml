  <para>
    This command loads an &image; into an existing &micro;.  The new
    &image; must have the same <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Coordinates">physical and
    pixel sizes</link> as the &micro;.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      All &images; in &oof2; must be associated with &micros;.  To
      load an &image; without a preexisting &micro;, use <xref
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Microstructure.Create_From_ImageFile"/>
      instead.
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    The image file can be in any format understood by the <ulink
    url="http://www.imagemagick.org"
    role="external">ImageMagick</ulink> library.  All the common
    formats (jpg, gif, ppm, png, tif,
    <foreignphrase>etc.</foreignphrase>) are acceptable.
  </para>
  <para>
    The new &image; will be identified within the &micro; by its
    <varname>filename</varname> (after stripping off any directory
    path components).  If there is already an &image; with that name
    in the &micro;, then <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput> will be
    appended to the name, where <userinput>x</userinput> is an
    integer.
