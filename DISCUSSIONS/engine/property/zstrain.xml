<para>
  A plane-strain solution of the elasticity equations is one in which
  the <varname>zz</varname> component of the strain is zero.  Using a
  nonzero value of the ZStrain &property; imposes a constant
  <emphasis>non-zero</emphasis> <varname>zz</varname> value,
  <varname>ezz</varname>, of the out of plane strain.  It behaves like
  a <link linkend='PropertyType-ThermalExpansion'>thermal
  expansion</link> &property; that only operates in the
  <varname>z</varname> direction (and is independent of temperature).
