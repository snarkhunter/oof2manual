  <para>
    Active Areas provide a mechanism for restricting the scope of
    &oof2; operations to a portion of a &micro;.  The Active Area is
    defined in terms of a set of pixels, called the <quote>active
    pixels</quote>. Pixel operations will be restricted to active
    pixels.  Operations on &skel; &nodes; will be restricted to &nodes;
    with positions inside active pixels.  Active &skel; &elems; are
    defined as &elems; with at least one active &node;, and active
    &skel; &sgmts; are those with an active &node; at either end.  Thus
    active &elems; and &nodes; can extend outside the Active Area.
  </para>
  <para>
    This menu contains commands for manipulating Active Areas.  &oof2;
    maintains a list of previously used Active Areas, so it's possible
    to go back and reuse old areas.  It's also possible to assign
    names to Active Areas to make it easier to store and recall them.
  </para>
  <caution>
    <para>
      Not all &oof2; operations respect the Active Area.  Most &skel;
      and &micro; operations do (such as <link
      linkend="RegisteredClass-Refine">element refinement</link> or
      <link linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection">pixel
      selection</link>), but most &image; and &mesh; operations do
      not.<footnote>
	<simpara>
	  &image; modifications do not use the Active Area because
	  they are mostly implemented by external libraries which
	  don't know about &oof2; internal structures.
	</simpara>
      </footnote>
      In particular, none of the <command>Undo</command> or
      <command>Redo</command> commands pay any attention to Active
      Areas -- they can change &micros; or &skels; in inactive
      regions.
    </para>
  </caution>
  <para>
    Like pixel selections, Active Areas all belong to a particular
    &micro;.  Activating pixels in one &micro; has no effect on pixels
    in another &micro;.  It's possible to <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ActiveArea.Copy"><command>Copy</command></link>
    an Active Area from one &micro; to another, though.
  </para>
  <para>
    <xref linkend="Figure-Active"/> shows how the Active Area is used
    for pixels, &elems;, &nodes;, and &sgmts;.  When an Active Area is
    being used, the inactive pixels are dimmed in &image; and &micro;
    <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-DisplayMethod">displays</link>. (Inactive
    &skel; components are <emphasis>not</emphasis> dimmed,
    unfortunately.)  The amount of dimming can be adjusted by editing
    the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-BitmapOverlayDisplayMethod"/>
    for the Active Area in the &layereditor;.
