<para>
  The two parameters, <varname>internal</varname> and
  <varname>boundary</varname> determine exactly which &nodes; will be
  pinned.  If <varname>internal</varname> is
  <userinput>true</userinput>, then &nodes; that are completely
  surrounded by selected &elems; will be pinned.  If
  <varname>boundary</varname> is <userinput>true</userinput>, then
  &nodes; that are only partially surrounded by selected &elems; will
  be pinned.  If both are <userinput>true</userinput>, then all
  &nodes; of the selected &elems; will be pinned. <xref
  linkend="Figure-pinelements"/> illustrates the different scenarios.

        A &skel; containing some red selected &elems;.  The yellow
