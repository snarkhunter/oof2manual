  <para>
    This command loads an <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-OrientationMap"><classname>Orientation
    Map</classname></link> into the given pre-existing &micro;.  The
    &micro; must have the same physical and pixel <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Coordinates">dimensions</link>
    as the <classname>Orientation Map</classname>, and must not
    contain another <classname>Orientation Map</classname>.
  </para>
  <para>
    (To create a <emphasis>new</emphasis> &micro; directly from an
    orientation map file, see <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Microstructure.Create_From_OrientationMap_File"/>.
    This obviates the need to ensure that the map and &micro; have the
    same dimensions.)
