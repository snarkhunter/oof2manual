  <para>
    It's often necessary to switch back and forth between using an
    &active; to restrict &oof2; operations and working without an
    &active;.  In these situations, it's a nuisance to be continually
    changing the currently active pixels. The
    <command>Override</command> menu command comes in handy here.
    When switched <emphasis>on</emphasis>, the entire &micro; gets
    temporarily activated, regardless of the current &active;.  When
    switched <emphasis>off</emphasis>, the current &active; is again
    in effect.
  </para>
  <para>
    In particular, it's convenient to override the current &active;
    when it's necessary to select more pixels in order to <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ActiveArea.Activate_Selection">add</link>
    them to the &active;.
