  <para>
    A quadrilateral has a four neighboring &elems;.  If it has two
    neighbors of one type (defined by their dominant <link

    category</link>) and two of another, arranged as in <xref
    linkend="Figure-split_pattern"/>(a), and if the &elem; itself is
    inhomogeneous, then there's a good chance that dividing it along
    the diagonal shown in (b) will improve the homogeneity of the &skel;.

  <para>
    <classname>GeographicQ2T</classname> can be fast because it only
    examines quads with a high likelyhood of being splittable.
    However, it can skip over splittable quads if the &skel; is not
    already sufficiently refined and one of the neighbors has the
    wrong type. <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-TrialAndErrorQ2T"/> is
    slower but more thorough.
