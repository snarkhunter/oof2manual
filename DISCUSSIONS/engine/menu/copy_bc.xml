<para>
  <command>OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Conditions.Copy</command> copies a
  existing <link linkend="RegisteredClass-BC">boundary
  condition</link>.  It can be copied from one boundary to another
  within a &mesh;, or to a completely different &mesh;.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>current</varname> parameter is the name of the &mesh;
  <emphasis>from</emphasis> which the boundary condition will be
  copied.  The <varname>mesh</varname> parameter is the name of the
  &mesh; <emphasis>to</emphasis> which it will be copied.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>name</varname> must be unique among all of the boundary
  condition names in the target &mesh;.  If it is not unique, then
  <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput> will be appended to it, where
  <userinput>x</userinput> is a suitable integer.  If the name is
  <xref linkend="Object-automatic"/>, a name will be assigned
  automatically.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>boundary</varname> parameter specifies the boundary to
  which the copied boundary condition will apply. It must be the name
  of an existing <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundary</link> in the
  &skel; of the target &mesh;.
