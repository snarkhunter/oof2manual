  <para>
    <classname>PyroElectricity</classname> is a coupling property
    which, at its simplest, makes a contribution to the <xref
    linkend="Flux-Total_Polarization"/> &flux; proportional to the
    difference between the local <xref linkend="Field-Temperature"/>
    &field; and some specified reference temperature,
    <varname>T0</varname>.
</para>
  <para>
    In practice, the picture is more complicated than this.  For
    systems which have <link
    linkend='PropertyType-Elasticity'>elasticity</link>, <link
    linkend='PropertyType-ThermalExpansion'>thermal expansion</link>,
    and <link
    linkend='PropertyType-PiezoElectricity'>piezoelectricity</link>,
    users may wish to model the phenomenon of secondary
    pyroelectricity, in which an effective pyroelectric coupling
    arises as a result of the interactions of the other three
    properties, with a coefficient proportional to the product of the
    other three coefficients.
  </para>
  <para>
    In &oof2;, this effect can be included by adding a
    <classname>Pyroelectricity</classname> property to your material
    and setting the <varname>coefficient_type</varname> parameter to
    <userinput>Constant stress</userinput>.  The additional
    ("secondary") contribution will be added in automatically.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that the property allows users to specify the pyroelectric
    coefficient at constant strain, also.  In this case, &oof2; will
    assume that the user has fully specified the desired pyroelectric
    physics, and will not compute a secondary pyroelectric
    contribution.
  </para>
  <para>
    A &material; with a <classname>PyroElectricity</classname>
    &property; must also contain an <link
    linkend="PropertyType-Orientation">orientation</link>
    <classname>property</classname>.  There is no isotropic
    pyroelectricity.
  </para>
