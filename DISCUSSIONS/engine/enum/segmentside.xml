<para>
  <classname>SegmentSide</classname> selects the left or right side of
  an &elem; &sgmt; when evaluating <link
  linkend="Section-Output"><classname>Outputs</classname></link> on a
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonEdgeBoundaryDomain"/>.
</para>
<para>
  When evaluating an <link
  linkend="Section-Output"><classname>Output</classname></link> along
  a &sgmt; separating two &elems;, the result may depend upon whether
  the evaluation point is considered to be in one &elem; or the other,
  because &fields; and &fluxes; may be discontinuous at the boundary.
  &skel; <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge">edge
  boundaries</link> are directed, having a beginning and an end, so
  it's possible to specify which &elem; to use for the evaluation by
  choosing the one on the left or right side of the boundary.
  <quote>Left</quote> means <quote>On the left if you were on the
  boundary and facing towards its end.</quote>
</para>
<para>
  If a boundary is external and only has an &elem; on one side, that
  element will be used regardless of the
  <classname>SegmentSide</classname> selected.
</para>
