<para>
  <classname>WriteMode</classname> is used when opening output files
  of all sorts. Choosing <userinput>w</userinput> (which shows up in
  the GUI as <guilabel>write</guilabel> or
  <guilabel>OVERWRITE</guilabel>) will cause the existing contents of
  the file to be deleted when new data is added. Choosing
  <userinput>a</userinput> (<guilabel>append</guilabel> in the GUI)
  will cause the old data to be preserved, and new data to be appended
  to it.
</para>
<para>
  If a file doesn't already exist, there's no difference between
  opening it with <userinput>w</userinput> and with
  <userinput>a</userinput>.  However, if a data file is saved in a GUI
  session, and then the session is <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.File.Save.Python_Log">saved</link> as a <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-FileFormats">script</link> and the script
  is reloaded, the file mode of the data file
  <emphasis>will</emphasis> make a difference, because the data file
  will exist when the script reopens it.  The script will contain the
  <classname>WriteMode</classname> that was used in the original GUI
  session.
