<para>
  The <command>Modify</command> command applies a modification
  operator to a &skel;.  The available operations are listed in the
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier"/> class.
</para>
<para>
  A good &skel; must be (1) a faithful representation of its &micro;
  and (2) composed of well-shaped elements. An element's quality is
  measured by its <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity'>homogeneity</link>
  and its <link linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Shape_Energy'>shape
  energy</link>.  Modifications to &skels; naturally aim at either
  better adaptation to material boundaries
  (<emphasis>homogeneity</emphasis>), or better element shape
  (<emphasis>shape energy</emphasis>), or both.
</para>
<para>
  &oof2; provides various <link
  linkend='RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier'>tools</link> to help
  adapt a &skel; to its material boundaries. Unfortunately, these
  tools are not magic wands that you can swing to automatically create
  perfect &skels;. These tools work best with careful intervention
  and, therefore, users should learn the basics of each <link
  linkend='RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier'>modification tool</link>.
  Fortunately, once a sequence of operations has been found that works
  well on one &micro;, it's likely to work well on other related
  &micros;.  See the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier"/> reference page for more
  information.
</para>
<para>
  To apply a <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier"/> to
  only part of a &skel;, either use an &active; or the tools for
  pinning &nodes; in the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.PinNodes"/> menu.
