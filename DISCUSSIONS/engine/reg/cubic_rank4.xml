  <para>
    The <classname>CubicRank4Tensor</classname> represents rank 4
    tensor properties with cubic rotational symmetry, such as
    cubic elasticity.  The cubic rank 4 tensor has three
    independent components, as shown in <xref
    linkend='Figure-CubicRank4Tensor'/>.  Because the elasticity
    literature uses many different representations of these two
    components, &oof2; allows you to enter the tensor in a variety of
    formats.

    <para>
      The word <quote>rank</quote> has different meanings in different
      fields.  Here it means the number of indices on a
      tensor.
