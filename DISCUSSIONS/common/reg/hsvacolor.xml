<para>
  <classname>HSVAColor</classname> specifies a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OpaqueColor"/> in terms of its
  <varname>hue</varname>, <varname>saturation</varname>,
  <varname>value</varname> and opacity (<varname>alpha</varname>).  We
  stole our algorithm for converting between <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-RGBColor">RGB</link> and HSV from <ulink
  url="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~ncs/color/t_convert.html"
  role="external"/>.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>hue</varname> is angle on the color wheel, in degrees. 0 or
  360 is red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue,
  and 300 is magenta.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>saturation</varname> describes the <quote>strength</quote>
  or <quote>purity</quote> of the color.  It's a floating point number
  between 0 and 1.  Low values give pale, washed-out colors, tending
  toward white.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>value</varname> is the brightness of the color.  It too is
  a floating point number between 0 and 1, where 0 is darkest and 1 is
  brightest.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>alpha</varname> is the opacity of the color. It is a
  floating point number between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely
  transparent and 1 is completely opaque.
</para>
