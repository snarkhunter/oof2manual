<para>
  <classname>OutputStream</classname> is the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/> that sends data from a
  <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Output</link> to a file.  <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/>s are assigned to <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/>s by the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-ScheduledOutput">Scheduled Output</link> page
  and the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Destination.Set"/>
  command.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>mode</varname> is <userinput>w</userinput>, the file
  will be opened for writing, and any existing file contents will be
  overwritten.  If <varname>mode</varname> is
  <userinput>a</userinput>, the file will be opened for appending, and
  the new data will appear at the end.  Note that if the file is ever
  <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Destination.Rewind">rewound</link>,
  all data in the file will be overwritten even if the file had been
  opened for appending.
</para>
<para>
  The output file will begin with a header containing comments
  describing the source of the data and the contents of each column.
  The characters demarcating the <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.Output_Formatting.Comment_Character">comments</link>
  and dividing the <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.Output_Formatting.Separator">columns</link>
  can be selected in the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.Output_Formatting"/> menu in the main
  &oof2; menubar.
</para>
<para>
  More than one <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/> can
  use the same <classname>OutputStream</classname>.<footnote>
  <para>
    The class is called <classname>OutputStream</classname> instead of
    <classname>OutputFile</classname> to emphasize the fact that two
    streams can refer to the same file.
  </para>
</footnote>
  In that case, the file's <varname>mode</varname> is the last one
  assigned.  The data from the various <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/>s will be interleaved in
  the file, but each type of data will be preceded by comments
  identifying it.
