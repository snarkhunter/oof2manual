<para>
  Using <classname>BasicUniformDriver</classname> as the
  <varname>time_stepper</varname> in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/> tells &oof2; to <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solving">solve</link> a time
  dependent problem using uniform stepping, in which all time steps
  are the same size.
</para>
<para>
  Uniform stepping requires less computation per step than <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicAdaptiveDriver">adaptive</link>
  stepping, but can be either much less accurate (if the step size is
  too large) or much less efficient (if the step size is too small).
</para>
<para>
  <classname>BasicUniformDriver</classname> automatically uses the
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SS22"/> method with <code>theta1 =
  theta2 = 0.5</code> if the equations contain second order <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Time-Dependence">time derivatives</link>.
  It uses <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-CrankNicolson"/> otherwise.
