<para>
  Active Areas provide a mechanism for restricting the scope of &oof2;
  operations to a portion of a &micro;.  The Active Area is defined in
  terms of a set of pixels, called the <quote>active
  pixels</quote>. Pixel operations will be restricted to active
  pixels.  Operations on &skel; &nodes; will be restricted to &nodes;
  with positions inside active pixels.  Active &skel; &elems; are
  defined as &elems; with at least one active &node;, and active
  &skel; &sgmts; are those with an active &node; at either end.  Thus
  active &elems; and &nodes; can extend outside the Active Area.
</para>
<para>
  This menu contains commands for manipulating Active Areas.  &oof2;
  maintains a list of previously used Active Areas, so it's possible
  to go back and reuse old areas.  It's also possible to assign names
  to Active Areas to make it easier to store and recall them.
</para>
<para>
  The GUI tools for manipulating Active Areas are on the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Active_Area">Active Area</link> Page.
</para>
<caution>
  <para>
    Not all &oof2; operations respect the Active Area.  Most &skel;
    and &micro; operations do (such as <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Refine">element refinement</link> or
    <link linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection">pixel
    selection</link>), but most &image; and &mesh; operations do
    not.<footnote>
	<simpara>
	  &image; modifications do not use the Active Area because
	  they are mostly implemented by external libraries which
	  don't know about &oof2; internal structures.
	</simpara>
    </footnote>
    In particular, none of the <command>Undo</command> or
    <command>Redo</command> commands pay any attention to Active Areas
    &#x2014; they can change &micros; or &skels; in inactive regions.
    </para>
</caution>
<para>
  Like pixel selections, Active Areas all belong to a particular
  &micro;.  Activating pixels in one &micro; has no effect on pixels
  in another &micro;.  It's possible to <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ActiveArea.Copy"><command>Copy</command></link>
  an Active Area from one &micro; to another, though.
</para>
<para>
  <xref linkend="Figure-Active"/> shows how the Active Area is used
  for pixels, &elems;, &nodes;, and &sgmts;.  When an Active Area is
  in use, the inactive pixels are dimmed in &image; and &micro;
  <link linkend="RegisteredClass-DisplayMethod">displays</link>.  The
  amount of dimming can be adjusted by editing the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BitmapOverlayDisplayMethod"/> in the
  graphics window.<footnote>
  <simpara>
    If you want the dimming to apply to all &layers; in the Canvas,
    move the Active Area layer to the top of the layer list with <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Raise.To_Top"/>.  This will
    produce funny effects, such as partially dimming &elems; that have
    both active and inactive &nodes;.
