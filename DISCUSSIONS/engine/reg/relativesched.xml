  Using an <classname>RelativeOutputSchedule</classname> in <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Schedule.Set"/> means
  that the times produced by the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> are interpreted as relative
  times, and are offset by the starting time of the time evolution
  calculation.
</para>
<para>
  For example, if the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> is
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Periodic"/> with
  <varname>delay</varname>=0 and <varname>interval</varname>=0.1, the
  initial time for the simulation is 0.05, then the output times will
  be 0.15, 0.25, 0.35, and so on.

<para>
  Compare to <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AbsoluteOutputSchedule"/>.
