<para>
  A <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Output</link> with a <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> set
  to <classname>Geometric</classname> will be performed at time
  intervals that grow by a constant factor at each step.  If the
  associated <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduleType"/> is <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-RelativeOutputSchedule"/>, the output times
  will be offset by the starting time of the computation.  The first
  interval will be <varname>timestep</varname>, the second will be
  <varname>factor</varname> times larger. 
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>factor</varname> is less than 1.0 and the end time of
  the time evolution is too large, the computation may take a very
  long time to complete.

  There's a bug (feature?) in the implementation of this class that
  may produce surprising results when <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solving-Times">continuing</link> a
  time evolution.  If the end time of the calculation does not
  coincide with a scheduled output time, the next output time will be
  skipped.  For example, with <varname>factor</varname>=2 and
  <varname>timestep</varname>=0.1, the output times are 0.1, 0.3, 0.7,
  1.5, <foreignphrase>etc</foreignphrase>.  If the end time is 1, the actual 
  output times will be 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, and 1.0.  If the solution is
  continued, the next time will be 3.1, skipping 1.5.
