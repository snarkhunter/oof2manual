<para>
  Subclasses of <classname>MatrixMethod</classname> specify the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solvers-Matrix">matrix equation
  solver</link> to be used in <xref

</para>
<para>
  The different types of <classname>MatrixMethod</classname> are
  applicable to different types of matrix equations.  The reference
  page for each subclass gives some information about its
  applicability.  In particular, solution methods for
  <emphasis>symmetric</emphasis> matrices can take advantage of the
  symmetry to obtain a solution more efficiently.  &oof2; constructs
  symmetric matrices when possible, and only allows the symmetric
  solver (<xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ConjugateGradient"/>) to be
  used in those cases.
</para>
<para>
  The matrices that arise in finite element calculations are generally
  <emphasis>sparse</emphasis>, meaning that many of their entries are
  zero.  Sparse matrices can be stored efficiently by only retaining
  the non-zero values.  The <emphasis>iterative</emphasis>
  <classname>MatrixMethods</classname> have the advantageous property
  of not requiring storage for the full matrix.  <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-DirectMatrixSolver">Direct</link> solvers,
  on the other hand, generate intermediate values at all matrix
  entries, and so their storage requirements are much larger.
