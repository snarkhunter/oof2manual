<para>
  Using a <classname>ConditionalOutputSchedule</classname> as the
  <varname>scheduledtype</varname> argument in <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Schedule.Set"/> means
  that the times produced by the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> are determined on-the-fly by
  the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> object.  The
  <classname>ConditionalOutputSchedule</classname> doesn't do anything
  except to state that the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduleType"/> is neither <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AbsoluteOutputSchedule">absolute</link> nor
  <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-RelativeOutputSchedule">relative</link>.
</para>
<para>
  In principle, conditional outputs could be produced when the
  &fields; or &fluxes; meet some criterion, or when an error estimate
  is within some bounds.  At the current time, however, there is only
  one conditional <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/>, <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-EveryTime"/>, and its
  <quote>conditional</quote> nature is suspect.
