  <para>
    As well as keeping track of which &nodes; are currently <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.PinNodes">pinned</link>, each
    &skel; maintains a stack of previous sets of pinned &nodes;.
    Whenever nodes are pinned or unpinned, a new set is pushed onto
    the stack.  The <command>Undo</command> command pops the latest
    version off of the stack, thereby reverting to the previous set of
    pinned &nodes;.  The popped version is not destroyed &#x2014; it can be
    recovered with the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.PinNodes.Redo"/> command.
  </para>
  <para>
    The stack is not infinite.  When it is full, the oldest set of
    pinned &nodes; will be lost to make room for a new one.
