<para>
  The <command>Solve</command> command obtains the solution of all of
  the &subproblems; of the given &mesh;, if those &subproblems; have
  <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solvers">solvers</link>
  assigned to them, and if the solution hasn't been <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Subproblem.Disable_Solution">disabled</link>.
</para>
<para>
  In the GUI, this command is invoked from the
  <guibutton>Solve</guibutton> button on the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Solver">Solver</link>
  page. <varname>endtime</varname> is read from the <guilabel>end
  time</guilabel> box on the page.  After a time-dependent solution is
  completed, the <guibutton>Solve</guibutton> button changes to a
  <guibutton>Continue</guibutton> button, but it still invokes this
  same <command>OOF.Mesh.Solve</command> command.
