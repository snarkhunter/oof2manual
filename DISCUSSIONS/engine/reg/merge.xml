  <para>
    <classname>MergeTriangles</classname> merges two triangular
    &elems; into one quadrilateral &elem;.
  </para>

  <para>
    <classname>MergeTriangles</classname> is more or less the opposite of
    <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SplitQuads"/>, which splits a
    quadrilateral into two triangles. Given the nature of the process
    (merging elements), it is easy to see that it focuses mostly on
    reducing elements' <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Shape_Energy">shape
    energy</link> rather than increasing elements' <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homog_Energy">homogeneity</link>.
    It also reduces the overall degrees of freedom in the resulting
    &mesh;, thereby decreasing the solution time (and accuracy), if
    the &mesh; is going to be built from <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Geometry">high-order</link>
    elements.  For &meshes; made of linear elements (4-noded quads or
    3-noded triangles) Merging Triangles does not reduce the number of
    degrees of freedom.
  </para>

  <para>
    The <varname>targets</varname> parameter specifies which &elems;
    in the &skel; to examine.  Taking the &elems; in random order,
    &oof2; tries to merge each &elem; with <emphasis>each</emphasis>
    of its neighbor elements in turn (whether or not they're in the
    target list), if the neighbor is a triangle and has the same <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-PixelCategory">dominant pixel
    type</link> as the target &elem;.  The
    <varname>criterion</varname> parameter specifies which, if any, of
    the possible merges to accept.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    <xref linkend="Figure-before_merge"/> shows a few highlighted
    triangle pairs to be merged. The resulting &skel; is shown in
    <xref linkend="Figure-after_merge"/>.
