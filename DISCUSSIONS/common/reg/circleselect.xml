  The <varname>source</varname> parameter is the <link

  &image;.  If it's an &image;, the selection is made in the &micro;
  in which the &image; resides.

<para>
  The <varname>points</varname> parameter is a <link
  linkend="Object-list">Python list</link> of <link

  &micro;, indicating the mouse motion.  The first point is the

<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
  parameters govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>) the
  shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
  initiated this command.
