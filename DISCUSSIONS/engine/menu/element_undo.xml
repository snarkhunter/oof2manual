<para>
  Each &skel; maintains a stack of previous &elem; selections.
  Whenever &elems; are selected or deselected, a new version is pushed
  onto the stack.  The <command>Undo</command> command pops the latest
  version off of the stack, thereby reverting to the previously
  selected set of &elems;.  The popped set is not destroyed &emdash;
  it can be recovered with the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.ElementSelection.Redo"/> command.
</para>
<para>
  The selection stack is not infinite.  When it is full, the oldest
  selection will be lost when a new selection is made.  The size of
  the stack can be changed with <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.UndoBuffer_Size.Skeleton_Selection.Element"/>
  or <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.UndoBuffer_Size.Skeleton_Selection.All"/>.
