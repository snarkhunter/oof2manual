<para>
  <classname>Newton</classname> is a <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-NonlinearSolverBase">nonlinear
  solver</link> used in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/> for solving nonlinear
  equations of the form
  <equation id="Eqn-Newton0">
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ A(\phi) = 0 \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  It implements <ulink
  url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtons_method"
  role="external">Newton's method</ulink>, which uses the derivative
  of the nonlinear term <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(A\)</alt></inlineequation> with respect to the vector
  of unknowns, <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\phi\)</alt></inlineequation>
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> &field; values), to compute
  successive approximations to the solution.  The iteration stops when
  the norm of the residual after the
  n<superscript><emphasis>th</emphasis></superscript> step,
  |A<subscript><emphasis>n</emphasis></subscript>|, satisfies
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ |A_n| &lt; \epsilon|A_0| + \delta \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\epsilon\)</alt></inlineequation>=<varname>relative_tolerance</varname>
  and <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\delta\)</alt></inlineequation>=<varname>absolute_tolerance</varname>,
  or when the <varname>maximum_iterations</varname> limit is exceeded.
</para>
<para>
  Newton's method generally converges in fewer iterations than <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Picard"/>, but may require more work per
  iteration.
</para>
<para>
  Newton's method relies upon knowing the derivatives of the nonlinear
  function with respect to the unknowns, <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\( \partial A_i(\phi)/\partial \phi_j
  \)</alt></inlineequation>.  This information comes from the
  &material; &properties;, which determine the exact form of the
  equations being solved.  Nonlinear &properties; that are built into
  &oof2; provide routines to compute the derivatives, but &properties;
  defined in &oof2; <link
  linkend="Chapter-Extending">extensions</link> might not.  In this
  case, <classname>Newton</classname> will compute the derivatives
  numerically.  This will make <classname>Newton</classname> perform
  more computations on each iteration and quite possibly also require
  more iterations.  The parameters used for the numerical
  differentiation may be set by the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.Solver.Numerical_Differentiation"/>
  command.
