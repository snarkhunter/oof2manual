  <para>
    <classname>Domain</classname> objects are part of the
    post-solution <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework, in
    which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
    <classname>Domain</classname> is the subset of the &mesh; to which
    the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> is
    applied.  When the domain is set to
    <classname>ElementGroup</classname>, the sampling points are
    distributed inside the specified &mesh; &elems;.
  </para>
  <para>
    <classname>ElementGroup</classname> domains support <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> methods in the
    <link linkend="Sampling-point">point</link> and <link
      linkend="Sampling-element">element</link> categories.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>elements</varname> parameter specifies which elements
    to sample.  It should either be the name of an element group, or
    the special <link linkend="Object-Placeholder">placeholder</link>
    object, <userinput>selected</userinput>, indicating that the
    currently selected elements should be used.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      When sampling an <classname>ElementGroup</classname> on a grid,
      the grid is fit into the <classname>ElementGroup</classname>'s
      bounding box, that is, the smallest rectangle that contains all
      of the elements.  This means that it's possible that some of the
      grid points might not lie inside of an element in the group.
