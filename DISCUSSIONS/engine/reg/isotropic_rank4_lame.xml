<para>
  <classname>IsotropicRank4TensorLame</classname> is a <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-IsotropicRank4Tensor">rank 4 tensor with
  isotropic symmetry</link>, expressed in Lam&eacute; coefficients.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>lmbda</varname> is the Lam&eacute; <inlineequation>
  <alt role="tex">\(\lambda\)</alt>
</inlineequation>
coefficient, which is equal to
<inlineequation>
  <alt role="tex">\(C_{12}\)</alt>
  </inlineequation>.
  (The word <quote>lambda</quote> is a Python keyword, so it can't
  be used as a variable unless it's spelled wrong.)

<para>
  <varname>mu</varname> is the Lam&eacute;
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">\(\mu\)</alt>

  coefficient, equal to the shear modulus, or
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">\((C_{11}-C_{12})/2\)</alt>
