<section id="Section-Tasks-BdyAnalysis">
  <title>Boundary Analysis</title>
  <para>
    The Boundary Analysis Page computes quantities on the boundaries
    of a (presumably solved) mesh. This information can be used to
    compute the effective properties of materials.  The page is simply
    a GUI for the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Analysis"/> command.  Although
    it is similar in spirit to the <link
    linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis">Analysis Page</link>, it is
    substantially simpler because there are fewer operationa and fewer
    choices for domain and sampling.

  <para>
    As shown in <xref linkend="Figure-BdyAnalysisPage"/>, at the top
    of the page is a Mesh Chooser, consisting of a set of pull-down
    menus for choosing the &mesh; (and its &skel; and &micro;) to
    analyze.  The Time Chooser below it works identically to the one
    on the <link linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis-Time">Analysis
    Page</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
    Below the Time Chooser are two panes: the one on the left contains
    a list of boundaries, and the one on the right contains a
    pull-down menu listing the kinds of computations that can be done
    on the boundaries.  The computations are different kinds of <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshBdyAnalyzer"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    A computation is done by choosing a boundary on the left, an
    analysis method on the right, and pressing the
    <guibutton>Go</guibutton> button. The results will be sent to the
    destination (file or message window) set by the Destination Pane
    at the bottom of the window.  The Destination Pane is identical to
    its counterpart in the <link
    linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis-Destination">Analysis Page</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
    <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-NamedAnalysis">Named
    Analyses</link> can be created and retrieved here in the same way
    that they can be created on the <link
    linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis-Named">Analysis Page</link>,
    although the underlying menu commands are different.  This page
    uses <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Analysis.Create"/>
    to create a new Named Analysis, <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Analysis.Delete"/> to delete
    one, and <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Boundary_Analysis.SaveAnalysisDefs"/>
    to save one or more.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      In a future version this page will be merged with the <link
      linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis">Analysis Page</link>.
