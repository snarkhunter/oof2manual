<para>
  <command>PixelElementSelect</command> is a <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Select_Element">selection
  method</link> that selects &elems; in response to a mouse click in
  the <link linkend="Chapter-Graphics">graphics window</link> when
  the <link linkend="Section-Graphics-SkeletonSelection">Skeleton
  Selection</link> toolbox is active and is set to
  <quote>Element</quote> mode. It selects all &elems; with the same
  <link linkend="Section-Concepts-PixelCategory">dominant pixel
  type</link> as the pixel that was selected with the mouse. See
  <xref linkend="Figure-dompixsel"/> for some examples.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>skeleton</varname> is the &skel; from which the &elems; are
  to be selected.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>points</varname> is a <xref linkend="Object-list"/> of
  <xref linkend="Object-Point"/> objects.
  <classname>PixelElementSelect</classname> will select those
  &elems; whose dominant <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-PixelCategory">pixel category</link> is
  the same as that of the pixel containing the first point in the
  list. 
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname> parameters
  govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of &elems; defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the &elems;
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>)
  the shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click
  that initiated this command.

	    A &skel; for a &micro; with four pixel types.  Clicking on the
	    point shown in (a) selects all &elems; whose dominant pixel is
	    blue, shown by the bright red &elems; in (b).
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        (c) and (d) illustrate how this process might be confusing.
        In (c) the clicked point is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the
        dominant pixel for the clicked &elem;.  A white pixel has been
        selected, so in (d) the white &elems; are selected, which does
        not include the clicked &elem;.
