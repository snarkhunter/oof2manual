  <classname>DataFileOutput</classname> is the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/> that the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshFileOutput"/> uses to send <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled Output</link>

  The files written by <classname>DataFileOutput</classname> can be
  loaded back into &oof2; with the <xref

  startup command line option.

  If <varname>mode</varname> is <userinput>w</userinput>, the file
  will be opened for writing, and any existing file contents will be
  overwritten.  If <varname>mode</varname> is
  <userinput>a</userinput>, the file will be opened for appending, and
  the new data will appear at the end.  Note that if the file is ever
  <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Destination.Rewind">rewound</link>,
  all data in the file will be overwritten even if the file had been
  opened for appending.
