<para>
  An anisotropic stress-free strain &property;  makes an additive
  contribution of
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ -C_{ijkl} \epsilon^0_{kl} \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  to the <xref linkend="Flux-Stress"/>, where <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(C_{ijkl}\)</alt></inlineequation> is the &material;'s
  <link linkend="PropertyType-Elasticity">elastic</link> modulus, and
  <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\epsilon^0\)</alt></inlineequation> is a symmetric
  second rank tensor given by the <varname>epsilon0</varname> parameter.
</para>
<para>
  If the only contributions to the <xref linkend="Flux-Stress"/> are
  linear elasticity and stress-free strain, then the full <xref
  linkend="Flux-Stress"/> is
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ \sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\left(\epsilon_{kl} - \epsilon^0_{kl}\right) \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  so <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\epsilon^0\)</alt></inlineequation> is the strain at
  which the <xref linkend="Flux-Stress"/> vanishes.
</para>
<para>
  The crystal symmetry of the material is reflected by the symmetry of
  the strain, <varname>epsilon0</varname>.  The symmetry of the
  stress-free strain should probably be compatible with the symmetric
  of the elasticity, although &oof2; does not enforce this
  restriction.  &materials; containing an anisotropic stress-free
  strain &property; must also contain an <link
  linkend="PropertyType-Orientation">orientation</link>
  <classname>property</classname>.
