  Enhance intensity differences between the lighter and darker
  portions of the given &image;.
</para>
<para>
  In a circle of the given <varname>radius</varname> (in pixel units),
  around each pixel in the image, the minimum and maximum intensity of
  all pixels in the circle are computed.  The central pixel's
  intensity is set to either the minimum or maximum, depending on
  which is closer to the pixel's original value.  In color images, the
  RGB channels are handled independently.

  This routine is similar to <ulink

  role="external"><code>skimage.filters.rank.enhance_contrast</code></ulink>
  in &skimage;, but it is applied to each RGB channel separately, and
  does not reduce the color resolution to 8 bits.

        The top row consists of two unprocessed images, a

        Si<subscript>3</subscript>N<subscript>4</subscript> (courtesy
        of C.-H. Hsueh) and a 640&times;375 print by M.C. Escher.  In
        the bottom row, the contrast has been enhanced with
        <varname>radius</varname>=5 for the micrograph and
        <varname>radius</varname>=10 for the print.
