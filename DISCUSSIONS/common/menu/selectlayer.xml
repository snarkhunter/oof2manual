  <para>
    Select a graphics &layer;.  The &layer; is specified by its
    position <varname>n</varname> in the window's layer list.  The
    unlisted layers must be counted when computing
    <varname>n</varname>.  This command isn't very friendly in
    scripts, because it can be hard to determine
    <varname>n</varname>.<footnote><simpara>Sorry about
    that.</simpara></footnote>
  </para>
  <para>
    Many GUI commands operate on the currently selected &layer; or its
    &layerset;.  In scripts or in text mode, it's not usually
    necessary to select a &layer; before operating on it, because most
    commands specify which layer they apply to.  There are exceptions,
    though.  The most important exception is the &layereditor;'s <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Send"><command>Send</command></link>
    command, which replaces the selected &layerset; in a Graphics
    window.
