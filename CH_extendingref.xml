  <title>OOF2 Extending Reference</title>
  <partintro>
    <para>
      This section contains the reference pages for the classes and
      functions that can be used when programming &oof2; extensions,
      and which are described in general in <xref
      linkend="part-extending"/>.  Both the C++ and Python interfaces
      are documented, when appropriate.  In general, only functions
      that are relevant to building &oof2; extensions are listed, and
      base class functions are not listed again in the derived
      classes.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both C++ and Python interfaces are listed at the top of each
      reference page.  If the Description section mentions only the
      C++ syntax, assume that the Python syntax is derived in a
      straightforward way from the C++ syntax.  In cases where there
      is a big difference between the C++ and Python interfaces for a
      class or function, it will be discussed explicitly.
