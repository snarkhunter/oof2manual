# MAN_OOF2

OOF2 computes the properties of materials, starting from real or
simulated 2D images of their microstructure.

This is the source code for the OOF2 manual, not for OOF2.  The OOF2
git repository is at github.com:usnistgov/OOF2.git.

To create the readable (ie, html) manual, see the instructions in
Makefile.
