    This command sets the font to be used in most of the GUI.  It
    applies to all labels, pull-down menus, buttons,
    <foreignphrase>etc.</foreignphrase> It does
    <emphasis>not</emphasis> apply to textual displays, like the
    Console window.

    The font name can be any font recognized by the <ulink
    url="http://www.pango.org" role="external">Pango</ulink> library.
    In GUI mode, this command brings up a font selection dialog, so
    the user doesn't have to know the names of the fonts installed on
    the system.

  <para>
    To automatically set the font for all &oof2; sessions,
    put this command in the file
    <filename>.oof2rc</filename> in your home directory, for example:
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
      OOF.Settings.Font.Widgets(fontname="Trebuchet MS 12")
    </literallayout>
    It's also possible to specify the font in the
    <filename>.gtkrc-2.0</filename> file in your home directory, like
    this:
    <literallayout class="monospaced">
      gtk-font-name = "Trebuchet MS 12"
    </literallayout>
    A font set in this way will be used in all programs that use the
    <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org/" role="external">gtk+</ulink>
    library.  In &oof2;, settings in <filename>.oof2rc</filename>
    override settings in <filename>.gtkrc-2.0</filename>.
