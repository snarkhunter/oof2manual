<para>
  If an &elem; is in more than one &elemgroup;, the &elem;'s
  &material; is the chronologically last one assigned to any of the
  groups to which the &elem; belongs.  Calling
  <command>Remove_Material</command> causes the &material; to be
  recomputed if necessary.  If after the removal none of an &elem;'s
  groups have an assigned &material;, the implicitly inherited
  &material; from the <link
  linked="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">dominant pixel</link>
  will be used instead.
</para>
<para>
  To verify what &material; is assigned to an &elem;, use the <link
  linkend="Section-Graphics-SkeletonInfo">Skeleton Info</link>
  toolbox.
