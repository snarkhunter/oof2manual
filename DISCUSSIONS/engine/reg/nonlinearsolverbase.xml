<para>
  Subclasses of <classname>NonlinearSolverBase</classname> implement
  different ways of solving nonlinear sets of equations, including the
  trivial case, <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-NoNonlinearSolver"/>,
  which is actually just a linear solver.
  <classname>NonlinearSolverBase</classname> objects are used as the
  <varname>nonlinear_solver</varname> argument to <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/> when specifying a
  solver in <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Subproblem.Set_Solver"/>.
