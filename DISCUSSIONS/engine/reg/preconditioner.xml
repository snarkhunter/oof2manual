  <para>
    <emphasis>Preconditioning</emphasis> is a technique for speeding
    the convergence of iterative matrix solvers by replacing a given
    matrix problem with an easier one.  The
    <varname>preconditioner</varname> parameter for the iterative
    <link linkend="RegisteredClass-MatrixMethod">linear solvers</link>
    is an object of the <classname>Preconditioner</classname> class.
  </para>
  <para>
    Simply put, preconditioning a linear matrix equation,
    <emphasis>Ax=b</emphasis>, means finding some matrix,
    <emphasis>M</emphasis>, which is close to the inverse of
    <emphasis>A</emphasis> and is easy to compute. Then instead of
    solving <emphasis>Ax=b</emphasis>, solve
    <emphasis>(MA)x=Mb</emphasis>.  Since <emphasis>MA</emphasis> is
    nearly the unit matrix, this equation is relatively easy to solve.

  <para>
    In practice, preconditioning a large sparse system is an imprecise
    science.  Different precondioners work better for different kinds
    of problems.  The best way of choosing one is to experiment and
    see which works best.  The reference pages for the various
    <classname>Preconditioner</classname> subclasses give some
    guidance, where possible.
