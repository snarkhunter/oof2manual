  <para>
    Select pixels that are similar in color to the pixel at a given
    location (the reference pixel).  When using the <link
    linkend="Section-Graphics-PixelSelection">Pixel Selection
    Toolbox</link>, this location is given by a mouse click. In text
    mode the location is the first entry in the
    <varname>points</varname> list.  Pixels selected in this way are
    not necessarily contiguous.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>source</varname> parameter must be the <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to an &image;.  The
    selection is made in the &micro; in which the &image; resides.
  </para>
  <para>
    Pixels will be selected if their color lies within a box of size
    2 &times; <varname>range</varname> in the three dimensional space
    defined by the three components of the color.  The different types
    of <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ColorDifference"/> define the
    box in different ways.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
    parameters govern how the current selection
    (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
    this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
    already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
    linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
    (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>) the
    shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
    initiated this command.
