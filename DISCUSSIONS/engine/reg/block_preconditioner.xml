  <para>
    The way that &oof2; constructs the <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-3D">generalized plane-stress</link>
    equations sometimes creates matrices that can not be
    preconditioned with the monolithic <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-UnitPreconditioner"><classname>UnitPreconditioners</classname></link>.
    For this reason, &oof2; includes a
    <classname>BlockPreconditioner</classname>, which treats the in-
    and out-of-plane equations differently.  For the in-plane parts of
    the matrix (rows corresponding to in-plane generalized forces and
    columns corresponding to in-plane field components) it uses the
    <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-UnitPreconditioner"/> specified by
    the <varname>inplane</varname> parameter.  For the out-of-plane
    parts, it explicitly solves the submatrix (block) associated with
    each node, ignoring couplings with other nodes and the in-plane
    components.
  </para>
  <para>
    For problems with no constraints on the out-of-plane &fluxes;,
    using the <classname>BlockPreconditioner</classname> is equivalent
    to using its embedded <varname>inplane</varname> <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-UnitPreconditioner"/>.
