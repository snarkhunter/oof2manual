<para>
  Save the contents of the <link linkend='Chapter-Graphics'>Graphics
  window</link> in a file.  Everything on the Canvas is saved, not
  just what's visible in the scrolling region.
</para>
<para>
  In the GUI, the <varname>filename</varname> widget at the top of the
  dialog box lets you choose the directory and file in which to store
  the resulting image.  The <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button will be
  desensitized if the file already exists, unless
  <varname>overwrite</varname> is <userinput>true</userinput>.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>pixels</varname> parameter determines the resolution of
  the saved file.  It is not the same as the number of pixels on the
  screen or the number of pixels in the &micro;.  If the region is
  square, the saved file will be
  <varname>pixels</varname>&times;<varname>pixels</varname> in size.
  If it's not square, the largest dimension will be
  <varname>pixels</varname>.  It's necessary to specify
  <varname>pixels</varname> even when saving in PDF format.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>background</varname> is <userinput>true</userinput>,
  then any area of the background that is visible within the region
  will be drawn in the resulting image.  If it's
  <userinput>false</userinput>, the background will be transparent (if
  possible).
</para>
<note>
  <para>
    To save just a portion of the Canvas, use <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.File.Save_Canvas_Region"/>.
