<para>
  When <link linkend="RegisteredClass-Refine">refining</link> a
  &skel;, &oof2; first decides which &sgmts; to subdivide. It chooses
  up to two locations on each &sgmt;.  Then it subdivides the interior
  of each &elem; in a way that is consistent with the subdivision of
  its &sgmts;, as provided by a <emphasis>refinement rule</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
  Often there is more than one way to subdivide an element's interior,
  and the refinement rule returns more than one possibility.  In this
  case, &oof2; chooses between them by picking the one that minimizes
  the resulting <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Energy">effective energy</link>.
  The best choice will depend upon the exact position of the original
  element's nodes, the positions of the segment subdivisions, and the
  pixels in the interior, all of which go into determining the shape
  and homogeneity energies of the new elements.
</para>
<para>
  Because there can be very many ways of subdividing an &elem;, the
  <varname>rules</varname> parameter of <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Refine"/> lets you choose between two
  refinement rule sets.  The <userinput>Large</userinput> rule set
  considers almost all possible ways of refining an element, while the
  <userinput>Quick</userinput> rule set examines just a few simple
  geometries (often only one) for each
  element. <userinput>Quick</userinput> often does a good enough job,
  and does it faster.  It may be more efficient to use
  <userinput>Quick</userinput> twice than to use
  <userinput>Large</userinput> once.
</para>
<para>
  For example, when subdividing each edge of a triangular element in a
  single spot, the <userinput>Quick</userinput> rule set offers only
  this configuration
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="FIGURES/refinement/111q.png" format="PNG"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    but the <userinput>Large</userinput> rule set also includes these
    options:
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="FIGURES/refinement/111a.png" format="PNG"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    as well as these
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="FIGURES/refinement/111b.png" format="PNG"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
    and all 26 geometries that can be derived from the
    <userinput>Quick</userinput> refinement by subdividing one or more
    of its quadrilaterals into two triangles
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="FIGURES/refinement/111c.png" format="PNG"/>
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
</para>
<para>
  Similarly, when bisecting one edge of a quadrilateral and trisecting
  a neighboring edge, the <userinput>Quick</userinput> rule set
  generates only the simple refinement
  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="FIGURES/refinement/2001q.png" format="PNG"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
  while the large rule set also considers these geometries
  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata fileref="FIGURES/refinement/2001L.png" format="PNG"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>
  and all the configurations that can be derived from them by
  splitting quadrilaterals into two triangles.
</para>
<para>
  The full set of 66 refinement rules is in
  <filename>SRC/engine/refinemethod.py</filename> in the &oof2; source
  code, along with ascii art diagrams like this for each:
  <literallayout class="monospaced">

   #  |               |   | \             |   |             / |
   #  |               |   |  \            |   |            /  |
   #  d---------------c   d   \           c   d           /   c

   #  |    \     /    |   |    \   \ /    |   |    \ /   /    |
   #  0-----a---b-----1   0-----a---b-----1   0-----a---b-----1 </literallayout>
