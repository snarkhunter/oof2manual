  <para>
    Each &image; in a &micro; has associated with it a stack of
    modified versions of the &image;.  When the &image; is <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Modify">modified</link>, the new
    version is pushed onto the stack.  The <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>
    command pops the topmost version off the stack, thereby reverting
    to the next older version.  The <command>Redo</command> command,
    undoes the <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>,
    by replacing the most recently popped &image; onto the stack.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      Undone modifications can be redone only if no new modifications
      have been made to the &image; since the time of the last <link
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>
      command.
