<para>
  When solving nonlinear equations with <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Newton"/>'s method, &oof2; needs to know
  the derivatives of some of the material &properties; with respect to
  the &field; values.  If the &properties; don't provide code that
  evaluates the derivatives, &oof2; can still use <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Newton"/>'s method by evaluating the
  derivatives numerically.  <varname>epsilon</varname> sets the size
  of the perturbation, relative to the &field; value, that is applied
  to the &field; values when differentiating the &property;.
</para>
<para>
  The default value of the relative perturbation is
  10<superscript>-5</superscript>.  An absolute perturbation less than
  16 times the double precision <ulink role="external"
  url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon"> machine
  epsilon</ulink> will never be used.

  In the GUI, this command is invoked from the
  <guimenuitem>Settings</guimenuitem> menu in the main &oof2; window's
  menubar.
