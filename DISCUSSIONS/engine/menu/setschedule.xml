<para>
  This command sets the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> for
  a <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Output</link>.  The <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/>
  determines when the output operation will be performed during a time
  evolution computation.  In the GUI, schedules are listed and
  manipulated in the <guilabel>Schedule</guilabel> column of the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-ScheduledOutput">Scheduled Output</link>
  page.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>scheduletype</varname> parameter indicates whether the
  given schedule is to be interpreted as absolute, relative, or
  conditional.  See <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduleType"/> for
  details.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>schedule</varname> determines how the output times are
  computed.  Different types of <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Schedule"/> objects can be used to produce
  outputs at a single specified time, at a number of uniformly spaced
  times, <foreignphrase>etc</foreignphrase>.
</para>
<para>
  The schedules for all active <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Outputs</link> in a &mesh; determine the times during a time
  evolution calculation at which output will be produced.  Because the
  time stepper chooses step sizes so as to exactly end a step at each
  scheduled output time, the choice of schedules can affect the
  results of the calculation.  The choice of schedule does
  <emphasis>not</emphasis> determine the start or end times of the
  evolution.  Those are determined by the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Solver">Solver</link> page.
