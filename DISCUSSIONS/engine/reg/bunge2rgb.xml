  <para>
    <classname>Bunge2RGB</classname> is an <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Angle2Color"/> that simply maps the
    <varname>phi1</varname>, <varname>theta</varname>, and
    <varname>phi2</varname> values of an <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Bunge"/> orientation to the
    <varname>red</varname>, <varname>green</varname>, and
    <varname>blue</varname> parameters of an <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-RGBColor"/>.  The values are scaled and
    shifted so that the the full orientation space maps to the full
    color space.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note that this isn't a great way to convert orientations to
    angles, because small changes in orientation can result in a large
    change in color.
