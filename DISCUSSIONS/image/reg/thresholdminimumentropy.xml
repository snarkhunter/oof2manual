<para>
  MinimumEntropy thresholding uses Li's Iterative Minimum Cross
  Entropy method.  It is a wrapper around the &skimage; routine <ulink
  url="https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.threshold_li"
  role="external"><code>skimage.filters.threshold_li</code></ulink>.
</para>
<para>
  The algorithm adjusts the threshold iteratively until the change in
  one iteration is less than the given <varname>tolerance</varname>.
  If <varname>tolerance</varname> is set to &automatic;, iteration
  proceeds until the change is smaller than the minimum difference
  between intensities in the image.
</para>
<para>
   The &image; is first converted from color to grayscale if
   necessary.
