<para>
  <classname>RemoveShortSide</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalizer"/> applied by the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalize"/> &skel; <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifier</link>.  It
  removes the shortest segment or segments of a quadrilateral &elem;.
  When used as part of a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SpecificRationalization"/>,
  <classname>RemoveShortSide</classname> is applied to &elems; in two
  categories:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The quadrilateral has one short side, as shown in lines (a)
        and (b) in <xref linkend="Figure-rationalshort"/>.  The
        rationalizer is used if the ratio of the lengths of the two
        shortest sides is greater than the given
        <varname>ratio</varname>.  The target element is converted
        into a triangle, and a neighboring &elem; is either converted
        into a triangle or deleted, depending on its shape.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        The quadrilateral has two short sides opposite one another, as
        shown in line (c) of <xref linkend="Figure-rationalshort"/>.
        The rationalizer is applied if the ratio of the length of the
        shorter long edge to the length of the longer short edge is
        greater than <varname>ratio</varname>.  The target &elem; is
        deleted and the neighboring &elems; are either turned into
        triangles or deleted.
      </para>

        (a) The highlighted quadrilateral &elem; has one short side
        neighboring a triangle. The short side is removed, turning the
        &elem; into a triangle and deleting the neighbor.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        (b) The neighbor is a quadrilateral and is turned into a
        triangle.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        (c) The highlighted &elem; is a quadrilateral with two
        opposing short sides.  The &elem; is removed, along with the
        neighboring triangle on the right.  The quadrilateral on the
        left becomes a triangle.
