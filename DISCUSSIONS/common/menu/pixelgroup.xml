<para>
  This menu contains commands for creating and manipulating <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Pixel_Group'><classname>PixelGroups</classname></link>.
  <classname>PixelGroups</classname> are named sets of pixels in a
  &micro;.  Many &oof2; operations work on either the currently <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-PixelSelection">selected
  pixels</link> or on a <classname>PixelGroup</classname> &#x2014; for
  example, &materials; can be <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Material.Assign">assigned</link> either to
  pixels in a group or to pixels in the selection.  In some sense,
  <classname>PixelGroups</classname> are simply
  <emphasis>named</emphasis> pixel selections.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>PixelGroups</classname> also play a role in creating
  &skels;: if a group is marked <constant>meshable</constant>, then
  the &skel; <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Modify">modification</link> methods
  try to place element edges on the boundaries of the group.  That is,
  membership in <constant>meshable</constant> groups is considered
  when computing the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">homogeneity</link>
  of a &skel; element.  The <constant>meshable</constant> flag is set
  by <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelGroup.Meshable"/>.
