<para>
  <classname>RemoveBadTriangle</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalizer"/> applied by the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Rationalize"/> &skel; <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifier</link>.  It
  removes triangular &elems; with excessively acute or obtuse
  interior angles from a &skel;.  When used as part of a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SpecificRationalization"/>, triangles
  will be removed only if they have an interior angle less than
  <varname>acute_angle</varname> or greater than
  <varname>obtuse_angle</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  <xref linkend="Figure-removebad0"/> shows the effect of
  <classname>RemoveBadTriangle</classname> when it's acting on acute
  angles.  <xref linkend="Figure-removebad1"/> shows its effect on
  triangles with obtuse angles.

        The results of applying

        triangular &elems; in the left images are shown in the right
        images.  In the top pair, the target &elem; and its neighbor,
        also a triangle, are both removed.  In the bottom pair, the
        neighbor is a quadrilateral (also highlighted) and is reduced
        to a triangle (highlighted on the right).

        The results of applying
        <classname>RemoveBadTriangle</classname> to the highlighted
        excessively obtuse triangles in the left images are shown in
        the right images.  The neighboring &elems; which are also
        modified are highlighted in both columns.  In the top pair of
        images, the neighbor is a triangle and is split in two after
        merging with the target triangle. In the bottom two pairs, the
        neighbor is a quadrilateral, which is either bisected or
        trisected after merging with the target triangle.
