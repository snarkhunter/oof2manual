      <para>
        The blue and pink pairs of &elems; on the left can replace
        their shared edge with new edges and become the one of the
        configurations on the right.  When two quadrilaterals are
        replaced by three, as in the right hand images in the top row,
        a new &node; is inserted at the average position of its
        neighbors.

<para>
  The general procedure for <classname>SwapEdges</classname>
  is as follows:
  <orderedlist  numeration="arabic">
    <listitem>
	  <para>
 	    Create a list of &elems; chosen by the
 	    <varname>targets</varname> <link
 	    linkend="RegisteredClass-SkelModTargets">parameter</link>.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
        Loop over the target &elems; in random order to avoid any bias
        due to the order in which they were created.
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              For the first &elem; in the list, try to swap edges with
              each of its neighbors in all the possible ways
              illustrated in <xref linkend="Figure-swap_cases"/>.
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Replace the &elem; and its neighbor in the &skel; with
              the swap that best satisfies the
              <varname>criterion</varname>, if any.  Remove the &elem;
              and its neighbor from the list. If no swap satisfies the
              <varname>criterion</varname>, do nothing.

   <xref linkend="Figure-swap"/> shows the application of
   <classname>SwapEdges</classname> in a &skel;.  The &elems; with
   &sgmts; marked in green in (a) have been replaced in (b).  The two
   pairs of &elem;s on the blue-white boundary have improved their
