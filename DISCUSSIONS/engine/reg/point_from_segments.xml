<para>
  <classname>PointFromSegments</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BoundaryConstructor"/>, used as the
  <varname>constructor</varname> argument of the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Boundary.Construct"/> command when
  building &skel; <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundaries</link>.  It
  creates <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge'>Point
  Boundaries</link> from the currently <link
  linkend='MenuItem-OOF.ElementSelection'>selected</link> &skel;
  &sgmts; or from a <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Groups'>group</link> of &sgmts;.
  The &sgmts; are specified by the <varname>group</varname> parameter,
  which must be either the name of a &sgmt; group or the special <xref
  linkend="Object-Placeholder"/> object,
  <userinput>selection</userinput>.  The boundary is constructed from
  the &nodes; at the end of every &sgmt; in the
  <varname>group</varname>, whether or not they're on the exterior of
  the set, as shown in <xref linkend="Figure-point_from_segments"/>.
