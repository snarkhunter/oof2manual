<para>
  Graphics &layers; are conceptually organized in a stack, with
  &layers; on the bottom drawn first, and layers on the top drawn
  last.  Higher &layers; therefore obscure the lower ones.  Raising a
  &layer; in the stack makes it more visible.  This command raises the
  given layer by <varname>howfar</varname> levels in the stack,
  lowering all the intervening layers by one level.
</para>
<para>
  In GUI mode, this command operates on the currently <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Select">selected</link>
  &layer;.  In text mode and in scripts, the &layer; is specified by
  its position <varname>n</varname> in the window's layer list.  The
  <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Settings.List_All_Layers">unlisted</link>
  layers and invisible (empty) layers must be counted when computing
  <varname>n</varname> and <varname>howfar</varname>.  This command
  isn't very friendly in scripts, because it can be hard to determine
  <varname>n</varname> and <varname>howfar</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>howfar</varname> is <userinput>1</userinput>, then this
  command is identical to <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Raise.One_Level"/>.
