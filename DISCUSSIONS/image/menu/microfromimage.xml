  <para>
    This menu command creates a second &micro; based on an &image;
    already loaded in another &micro;.  The new &micro; will have the
    same physical size and pixel size as the old &micro;, but will not
    inherit any other data from it (except for the &image;).
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>name</varname> parameter is the name of the new
    &micro;.  If set to <link
    linkend="Object-automatic"><constant>automatic</constant></link>
    (by checking the box in the GUI or entering
    <userinput>automatic</userinput> without quotation marks in
    scripts) the &micro; name will be taken from the &image; name.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>image</varname> parameter must be a <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to an existing &image;
    object.
  </para>
