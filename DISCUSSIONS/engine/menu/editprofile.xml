  <para>
    Edit the given <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition-NamedProfile">named
    <classname>Profile</classname></link>.  Editing is really
    replacing: the old <classname>Profile</classname> is replaced with
    a new one with the same name.  <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition">Boundary
    conditions</link> that used the old <classname>Profile</classname>
    will use the new one instead.
