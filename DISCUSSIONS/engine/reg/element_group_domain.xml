<para>
  <classname>Domain</classname> objects are part of the post-solution
  <link linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework,
  in which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
  <classname>Domain</classname> is the subset of the &mesh; to which
  the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> is
  applied.  When the domain is set to
  <classname>ElementGroup</classname>, the sampling points are
  distributed inside the specified &mesh; &elems;.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>ElementGroup</classname> domains support <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> methods in the
  <link linkend="Sampling-point">point</link> and <link
  linkend="Sampling-element">element</link> categories.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>elements</varname> parameter specifies which elements
  to sample.  It should either be the name of an &elem; group, or the
  special <link linkend="Object-Placeholder">placeholder</link>
  object, <userinput>selection</userinput>, indicating that the
  currently selected elements should be used.
</para>
<note>
  <para>
    When sampling an <classname>ElementGroup</classname> on a grid,
    the grid is fit into the <classname>ElementGroup</classname>'s
    bounding box, that is, the smallest rectangle that contains all of
    the &elems;.  This means that it's possible that some of the grid
    points might not lie inside of an &elem; in the group.  Those
    points will be ignored.
