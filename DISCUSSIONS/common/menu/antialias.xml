<para>
  <emphasis>Aliasing</emphasis> is what happens when you try to draw
  small objects on a computer screen where the size of the pixels is
  comparable to the size of the objects.  The &skel; edges shown in
  the top left image in
  <xref linkend="Figure-antialias_lines"/> are one pixel wide, and the
  diagonals are not smoothly drawn.  In the top right image the edges
  are 0.5 pixels wide, and half of them aren't visible at all.
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis>Antialiasing</emphasis>
  is a method for removing aliasing by making pixels bleed color into
  their neighbors.  The lower left image in <xref
  linkend="Figure-antialias_lines"/> contains antialiased edges of width 1.0,
  and they are much smoother than the aliased edges above them.  Even
  edges narrower than a single pixel can be drawn clearly, show in the
  bottom left image.

<para>
  Antialiasing can make line drawings look better, but it can cause
  problems when displaying filled polygons
  (<foreignphrase>e.g,</foreignphrase> <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonMaterialDisplay"/> or <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-FilledContourDisplay"/>).  When the
  antialiasing algorithm attempts to smooth diagonal edges of adjacent
  polygons, it can leave some space in between, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Figure-antialiasing2"/>.
