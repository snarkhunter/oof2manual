<para>
  Rewinding a file used as the destination of an <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs">Analysis</link> will cause the
  current contents of the file to be overwritten the next time the
  file is written, even if the file was originally opened in
  <quote>append</quote> mode.
</para>
<para>
  In the GUI, output files can be rewound from the
  <guilabel>Destination</guilabel> widgets on the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis">Analysis</link> and <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-BdyAnalysis">Boundary Analysis</link> pages
  and the <link linkend="Section-Graphics-CrossSection">Mesh Cross
  Section</link> toolbox.  If the same file has been used in a
  <guilabel>Destination</guilabel> widget and in an <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputStream"/> for a <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-ScheduledOutput">Scheduled Output</link>,
  rewinding the file and rewinding the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputStream"/> are identical operations.
