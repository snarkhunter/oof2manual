<para>
  Define a new output operation to be performed while solving a
  time-dependent problem on a &mesh;.  To be computed, the operation
  must have a schedule defined by <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Schedule"/> and a
  destination set by <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Destination"/>.
</para>
<para>
  Every operation in a &mesh; needs to have a unique name.  If the
  given <varname>name</varname> parameter is already in use in the
  &mesh;, a suffix of the form <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput> will
  be appended.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>output</varname> parameter defines the operation to
  be performed.  It can be any member of the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/> class.
</para>
