<para>
  When a new object, such as an &image; or &skel; is created, &oof2;
  needs to know whether or not to add it to a graphics window.
  Previous versions of &oof2; had a confusing policy governing which
  objects would be displayed and when.  To avoid confusion, there is
  now one unambiguous policy:
  <warning>
    Nothing is displayed unless you request that it be displayed.
  </warning>
</para>
<para>
  Fortunately, you can change this policy by setting
  <varname>policy</varname> in <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.New_Layer_Policy"/>.
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        <emphasis>Never</emphasis> is the default. New items are not
        displayed automatically.  To add items to a graphics window,
        use the <xref linkend="OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.New"/> menu item.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        <emphasis>Always</emphasis> is the opposite of Never. New
        items are always displayed in all graphics windows.  Images
        will be displayed as bitmaps.  &skels; and &meshes; will be
        displayed by their edges.  This probably isn't very useful if
        you have a lot of objects.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <simpara>
        <emphasis>Single</emphasis> is the most like the earlier
        behavior.  Objects will be automatically displayed in an
        existing graphics window if the window doesn't already contain
        a similar object.  Each window can contain one &image;, one
        &skel;, and so forth.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>
  Changing the policy from the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.Graphics_Defaults.New_Layer_Policy"/> menu
  will change it for all new graphics windows, but won't affect
  windows that are already open.  To change the behavior of open
  windows, use the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Settings.New_Layer_Policy"/> menu item in the
  already opened window.
