<para>
  Scale and shift each pixel so that the image uses the full range of
  intensity values (zero to one).  This increases the contrast in the
  &image;.  <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Modify.Equalize"><command>Equalize</command></link>
  often does a better job than <command>Normalize</command>,
  especially if an &image; contains just a few very dark or very light
  pixels.

        The top row consists of two unprocessed images, a
        200&times;200 micrograph of
        Si<subscript>3</subscript>N<subscript>4</subscript> (courtesy
        of C.-H. Hsueh) and a 640&times;375 print by M.C. Escher.  The
        bottom two images are the results of applying the
        <command>Normalize</command> modifier.  The dark colors are
        darker and the bright colors are brighter.
