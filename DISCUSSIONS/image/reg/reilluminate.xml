<para>
  Compensate for uneven lighting in an &image;.  The average
  brightness in a neighborhood of size <varname>radius</varname>
  around each pixel is compared to the average brightness of the
  whole &image;, and the pixel value is scaled by the resulting
  ratio. The <varname>radius</varname> is specified in units of the
  pixel size, and should be large compared to the size of the
  features in the image, but small compared to the size of the image
  itself.
