  <para>
    This command creates a new &micro; by reading an <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-OrientationMap"><classname>Orientation
    Map</classname></link> file.  The pixel and physical <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Coordinates">sizes</link>
    of the &micro; will be the same as the sizes of the orientation
    map.  The orientation data will be loaded into the &micro; after
    it's been created, and <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Pixel_Group">pixel
    groups</link> will be created for the phases identified in the
    data file, if possible.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>format</varname> argument indicates which type of
    orientation map data file is being loaded.  The available formats
    are listed at <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-OrientMapReader"/>.
    New formats can be added by writing a small amount of python code,
    as described in <xref
    linkend="Section-Coding-OrientationMapFormats"/>.
