<para>
  The Coulomb Equation is
  <equation id="Eqn-Coulomb">
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ \nabla\cdot{\bf D} - \rho = 0 \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(D\)</alt></inlineequation>  is
  the <link linkend="Flux-Total_Polarization">polarization</link> and
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\rho\)</alt></inlineequation> is
  a <link linkend="PropertyType-ChargeDensity">charge density</link>.
</para>
<para>
  Because &oof2; does not include magnetism, there are no time
  derivative terms in the Coulomb Equation.  &oof2; can only solve
  static and quasistatic polarization problems.
