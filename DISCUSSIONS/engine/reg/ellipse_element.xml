  <para>
    <command>EllipseElementSelect</command> is a <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Select_Element">selection
    method</link> that selects &elems; in response to a mouse click in
    the <link linkend="Chapter-Graphics">graphics window</link> when
    the <link linkend="Section-Graphics-SkeletonSelection">Skeleton
    Selection</link> toolbox is active and is set to
    <quote>Element</quote> mode.  It selects all &elems; lying within
    a ellipse swept out by dragging the mouse, as shown in <xref
    linkend="Figure-ellipse_elements"/>.  The ellipse is defined by
    the rectangle that bounds it.  Click the mouse on one corner of
    the rectangle and drag to the diagonally opposite corner.
  </para>
  <para>
    <varname>skeleton</varname> is the &skel; from which the &elems; are
    to be selected.
  </para>
  <para>
    <varname>points</varname> is a <xref linkend="Object-list"/> of
    <xref linkend="Object-Point"/> objects.  The first point in the
    list is one corner of the rectangle bounding the ellipse, and the
    second point is the diagonally opposite corner. Any other points
    in the list will be ignored.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
    parameters govern how the current selection
    (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of &elems; defined by
    this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the &elems;
    already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
    linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
    (<userinput>1</userinput>) or not (<userinput>0</userinput>) the
    shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
    initiated this command.
