  <para>
    Send the &layerset; from the &layereditor; to a <link
    linkend="Chapter-Graphics">Graphics window</link>.  If there is a
    layer <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Select">selected</link> in
    the Graphics window, the new &layerset; replaces the &layerset; of
    the selected &layer;.  Each &layer; in the new &layerset; replaces
    the corresponding &layer; in the Graphics window.  If no
    &layerset; is selected in the Graphics window, the new &layerset;
    is simply added to the window.
  </para>
  <para>
    When using the GUI, the <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.Settings.AutoSend"><command>AutoSend</command></link>
    command in the &layereditor;'s <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu
    controls whether or not newly edited layers are sent automatically
    when editing is complete.  By default, <command>AutoSend</command>
    is turned on.  When it's on, explicit <command>Send</command>
    commands are needed only when the displayed object is <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.DisplayedObject">changed</link>,
    or when &layers; are <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Delete_Method">deleted</link>.
    In scripts and in text mode, explicit <command>Send</command>
    commands are always required, and <command>AutoSend</command> is
    ignored.
  </para>
  <para>
    There is almost no cost in cpu time for resending a &layerset; to
    a Graphics window.  &layers; are not recomputed unless they have
    changed.  To force &layers; to be redrawn, use the <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.File.Redraw"><command>Redraw</command></link>
    command in the Graphics window's <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.File"><guimenu>File</guimenu></link>
    menu.
