<para>
  <command>OOF.NodeSelection.Select_From_Selected_Elements</command>
  provides three ways of selecting &nodes; based on a pre-existing
  &elem; selection.  The two parameters <varname>internal</varname>
  and <varname>boundary</varname> control which &nodes; will be
  selected.  If <varname>internal</varname> is
  <userinput>True</userinput>, then the &nodes; that are completely
  surrounded by selected &elems; will be selected.  If
  <varname>boundary</varname> is <userinput>True</userinput>, then
  &nodes; that are <emphasis>not</emphasis> completely surrounded by
  selected &elems; will be selected.

        The selected &elems; are shown in red. (a) With
        <varname>boundary</varname>=<userinput>True</userinput> and
        <varname>internal</varname>=<userinput>False</userinput>, only
        the &nodes; (blue dots) on the perimeter of the set of
        selected &elems; are selected. (b) With
        <varname>boundary</varname>=<userinput>False</userinput> and
        <varname>internal</varname>=<userinput>True</userinput>, only
        the &nodes; in the interior of the &elem; set are
        selected. (c) With both parameters <userinput>True</userinput>
        all nodes that are part of a selected &elem; are selected.
