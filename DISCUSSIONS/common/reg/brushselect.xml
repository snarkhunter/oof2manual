  <para>
    Select a contiguous set of pixels by sweeping the mouse over them.
    The mouse acts like a paintbrush with a size and shape given by
    the <varname>style</varname> parameter.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>source</varname> parameter is the <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to a &micro; or
    &image;.  If it's an &image;, the selection is made in the &micro;
    in which the &image; resides.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>points</varname> parameter is a <link
    linkend="Object-list">Python list</link> of <link
    linkend="Object-Point"><classname>Points</classname></link> in the
    &micro;.  The selected pixels will be those that are under the
    brush when the brush is centered on one of the specified
    <varname>points</varname> or on any point on the line segments
    joining them.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
    parameters govern how the current selection
    (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
    this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
    already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
    linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
    (<userinput>1</userinput>) or not (<userinput>0</userinput>) the
    shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
    initiated this command.
  </para>
