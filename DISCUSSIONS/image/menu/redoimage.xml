<para>
  Each &image; in a &micro; has associated with it a buffer of
  modified versions of the &image;.  When the &image; is <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Modify">modified</link>, the new version
  is stored in the buffer.  The <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>
  command restores the next oldest version from the buffer, thereby
  reverting to the next older version.  The <command>Redo</command>
  command, undoes the <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>, by
  restoring the next newest &image; from the buffer.
</para>
<note>
  <para>
    Undone modifications can be redone only if no new modifications
    have been made to the &image; since the time of the last <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>
    command.
