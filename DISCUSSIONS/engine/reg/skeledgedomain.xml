<para>
  <classname>Domain</classname> objects are part of the post-solution
  <link linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework,
  in which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
  <classname>Domain</classname> is the subset of the &mesh; to which
  the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> is
  applied.  When the domain is set to
  <classname>SkeletonEdgeBoundaryDomain</classname>, output is
  evaluated along the &sgmt; edges in the &mesh; corresponding to the
  given <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge">edge
  boundary</link>.

<para>
  <classname>SkeletonEdgeBoundaryDomain</classname> domains support
