  <para>
    <classname>AssignMaterial</classname> is a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshModification"/> subclass, used as the
    <varname>modifier</varname> argument to the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Modify"/> command.  It explicitly
    assigns a &material; to &mesh; elements.  This overrides the
    implicit &material; assignments from the &mesh;'s &micro; and
    &skel;.
  </para>
  <para>
    It should usually be unnecessary to explicitly assign &materials;
    to a &mesh;.  &oof2; data files created by the
    <application>oof</application> part of
    <application>OOF1</application> use
    <classname>AssignMaterial</classname> command because
    <application>OOF1</application>'s <application>oof</application>
    doesn't have a concept of &micro; or &skel;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>material</varname> parameter must be the name of an
    existing &material;.  The <varname>target</varname> parameter
    specifies to which elements the &material; will be assigned.
  </para>
