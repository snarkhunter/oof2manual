<para>
  The Plane Stress &equation; is
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ \sigma_{iz} = 0 \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\sigma_{ij}\)</alt></inlineequation> is the <xref
  linkend="Flux-Stress"/>.  It has three components, for
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(i=x,y,z\)</alt></inlineequation>.
  Activating the Plane Stress equation is one way to reduce a three
  dimensional problem to <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-3D">two
  dimensions</link>.  A system in plane stress can have out-of-plane
  strains but no out-of-plane forces, so it is equivalent to a thin
  free standing membrane in the x-y plane.  The three components of
  the plane stress equation add three constraints to each &node; of
  the &mesh;, corresponding to the three z-derivatives,
  <varname>Displacement_z</varname>, of the <xref
  linkend="Field-Displacement"/> &field; which have to be solved for.
