<para>
  <classname>ColorNorms</classname> are different ways of measuring
  the difference between <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OpaqueColor"><classname>Colors</classname></link>.
  They're used in the <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Pixel_Select.Burn"><command>Burn</command></link>
  pixel selection algorithm.<footnote>
  <para>
	<link
	    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Pixel_Select.Burn"><command>Burn</command></link>
	could have been defined using the <xref
	linkend="RegisteredClass-ColorDifference"/> classes instead,
	but it wasn't, for historical reasons.

<para>
  The difference between two colors in the <userinput>L1</userinput>
  norm is the average of the absolute values of the differences of
  their red, green, and blue values.  That is, it's the difference
  of the gray value equivalents of the colors.
</para>
<para>
  The difference between two colors in the <userinput>L2</userinput>
  norm is the square root of the sum of the squares of the
  differences of their red, green, and blue values.
