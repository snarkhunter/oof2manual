  <para>
    As well as keeping track of which &nodes; are currently <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.PinNodes">pinned</link>, each
    &skel; maintains a stack of previous sets of pinned &nodes;.
    Whenever nodes are pinned or unpinned, a new set is pushed onto
    the stack.  The <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Pin_Nodes.Undo">Undo</link>
    command operates on the specified &skel;, popping the latest
    configuration off of the stack, thereby reverting to the previous
    set of pinned &nodes;.  The <command>Redo</command> command undoes
    the last <command>Undo</command>, replacing the most recently
    popped set of pinned &nodes; onto the stack.
  </para>
  <para>
     The <varname>skeleton</varname> parameter is the fully-qualified name
     of the &skel; on which to operate.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
    Undone pinnings can be redone only if no new &nodes; were pinned
    or unpinned since the time of the last <command>Undo</command>.
    </para>
  </note>
  <para>
    <command>OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Pin_Nodes.Redo</command> is
    equivalent to <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.PinNodes.Redo"/>.
