      <para>
	Many &oof2; objects contain their own documentation.  The
	<link linkend="Chapter-Reference">reference section</link> of
	the &oof2; manual is generated automatically from the
	<varname>discussion</varname> data in menu items, <link
	linkend="Class-PropertyRegistration"><classname>PropertyRegistrations</classname></link>,
	<foreignphrase>etc</foreignphrase>.  Short
	<varname>discussions</varname> can be simple character
	strings, but longer discussions are more conveniently stored
	in separate files.  In those cases,
	<varname>discussion</varname> should be set to the return
	value of <code>loadFile(filename)</code>, where
	<varname>filename</varname> is the file containing the
	discussion.  The file must contain text that is suitable for
	inclusion in a <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org"
	role="external">DocBook</ulink>
	<literal>&lt;refentry&gt;</literal> element.<footnote>
	  <para>
	    The simplest such text would be a single paragraph
	    surrounded by <literal>&lt;para&gt;</literal> and
	    <literal>&lt;/para&gt;</literal> tags.
	  </para>
	</footnote>
      </para>
      <para>
	The <varname>func</varname> argument, if specified, should be
	a function that is called to preprocess the contents of the
	file before it's included in the manual.  The arguments to
	<varname>func</varname> are <varname>text</varname> (the
	contents of the file) and <varname>obj</varname> (the menu
	item or <classname>PropertyRegistration</classname> or other
	object being documented).
      </para>
      <para>
	The file specified by <function>loadFile</function> isn't
	actually read until the manual is built (using the command
	<xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Help.API_Listing"/>.)  That means
	that if you have no intention of building your own version of
	the manual, you can specify anything you want for the
	filename.  Of course, in that case you can also omit the
	<varname>discussions</varname> entirely as well.
      </para>
      <para>
	The given filename is assumed to be relative to the
	<filename>OOF2/MAN_OOF2</filename> directory.  Because of its
	size, this directory isn't included in the standard &oof2;
	distributions, so it will be difficult for extension authors
	to generate their own customized version of the manual.
	Please contact the &oof2; authors if you need a copy.
