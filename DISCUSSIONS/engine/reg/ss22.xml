<para>
  <classname>SS22</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-TimeStepper"/> that implements the SS22
  algorithm from Zienkiewicz and Taylor<footnote><simpara>
  O.C. Zienkiewicz and R.L. Taylor, <emphasis>The Finite Element
  Method</emphasis>, Fifth Edition, Volume 1, page
  511.</simpara></footnote>.  Like <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-CrankNicolson"/>, it is a second order
  method, so its error is of order <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(
  (\Delta t)^3 \) </alt></inlineequation> on each step.  Unlike <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-CrankNicolson"/> and the other time
  steppers in &oof2;, <classname>SS22</classname> integrates second
  order time derivatives directly, without resorting to equation <xref
  linkend="Eqn-Augmented"/>.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>SS22</classname> works by expanding the field values
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\phi\)</alt></inlineequation> in a
  Taylor series in time
 <equation id="Eqn-SS22expansion">
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ \phi = \phi_n + \tau\dot\phi_n + \frac12 \tau^2\alpha_n \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\phi_n\)</alt></inlineequation> and
  <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\dot\phi_n\)</alt></inlineequation> are vectors of
  &field; values and their time derivatives at time
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(t_n\)</alt></inlineequation>,
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\tau =
  t-t_n\)</alt></inlineequation> is the time within the time step, and
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\alpha_n\)</alt></inlineequation>
  is unknown.  This expression is inserted into the differential
  equation being solved (<foreignphrase>e.g,</foreignphrase> equation
  <xref linkend="Eqn-TimeDivergence"/>) and integrated over the
  duration <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\Delta
  t\)</alt></inlineequation> of the time step with a weighting
  function <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(W(\tau)\)</alt></inlineequation>.  <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(W(\tau)\)</alt></inlineequation> plays the role of a
  finite element shape function in the time coordinate.  The result is
  a matrix equation which can be solved for <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\alpha_n\)</alt></inlineequation>, which in turn gives
  the &field; values and time derivatives at the end of the step, via
  equation <xref linkend="Eqn-SS22expansion"/>.
</para>
<para>
  The exact form of the weighting function <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(W(\tau)\)</alt></inlineequation> turns out to be
  irrelevant.  All that is needed are its first and second moments,
  which must be provided as the parameters <varname>theta1</varname>
  and <varname>theta2</varname>.  The k-th moment is defined by
  <equation id="Eqn-SS22weight">
    <alt role="tex">
      \[
      \theta_k = \frac1{\Delta t^k}
      \frac{\int_0^{\Delta t} W(\tau) \tau^k\,d\tau}
      {\int_0^{\Delta t} W(\tau)\,d\tau}
      \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  Using small values near 0 will make <classname>SS22</classname> act
  more like an explicit method, and values near 1 will make it more
  like an implicit method.  Values near 0.5 seem to work well.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>SS22</classname> can be used on first order equations,
  such as the heat equation, although it's most advantageous for
  second order equations, like the force balance equation.
