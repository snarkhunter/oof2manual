<para>
  A <classname>ProfileXT</classname> object describes the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition-Profile">shape</link>
  of a <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition">boundary
  condition</link>.  That is, a boundary condition fixes some quantity
  (a &field; component, for example) on a boundary and the
  <emphasis>profile</emphasis> of the boundary condition specifies how
  that quantity varies along the length of the boundary.
</para>
<para>
  Profiles specified by <classname>ProfileXT</classname> can depend on
  both position and time.
</para>
<para>
  The <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ContinuumProfileXT"/>, <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ConstantProfile"/>, and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-LinearProfile"/> subclasses simply differ
  in how the profile is specified, with <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ContinuumProfileXT"/> being the most general
  and <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ConstantProfile"/> the least.
