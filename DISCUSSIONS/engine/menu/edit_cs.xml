<para>
  <quote>Edit</quote> the cross section named <varname>name</varname>
  in the given <varname>mesh</varname>.  Actually, the cross section
  is just replaced by the given <varname>cross_section</varname>,
  which must be an object of the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshCrossSection"/> class.  The GUI buttons
  for editing cross sections in the <link
  linkend="Section-Graphics-CrossSection">Cross Section toolbox</link>
  and the <link linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis">Analysis page</link>
  do the actual editing: they fill in a dialog box with the parameters
  for the cross section, and let the user change them.  Then they
  issue the <command>OOF.Mesh.Cross_Section.Edit</command> command
  with the new cross section.
