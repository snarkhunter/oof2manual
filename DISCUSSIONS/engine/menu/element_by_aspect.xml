<para>
  <command>Select_by_Aspect_Ratio</command> selects all &elems; which
  have aspect ratios greater than the given
  <varname>threshold</varname>.  See <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-CheckAspectRatio"/> for the definition of
  aspect ratio.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>only_quads</varname> is True, then triangular elements
  will not be selected.  If <varname>only_refineable</varname> is
  True, only quads that whose longest edges are not adjacent to one
  another will be selected.  These two settings allow
  <command>Select_by_Aspect_Ratio</command> to select only the
  elements that would be <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Refine">refined</link> with <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-CheckAspectRatio"/>.
