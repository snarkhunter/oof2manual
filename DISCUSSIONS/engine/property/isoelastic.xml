<para>
  The isotropic elasticity &property; specifies that the <xref
  linkend="Flux-Stress"/> depends linearly and isotropically on the
  gradients of the <xref linkend="Field-Displacement"/>,
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(u\)</alt></inlineequation>:
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ \sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\epsilon_{kl} \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\sigma_{ij}\)</alt></inlineequation> is the <xref
  linkend="Flux-Stress"/>, <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(C_{ijkl}\)</alt></inlineequation> is an isotropic
  fourth rank tensor given by the modulus <varname>cijkl</varname>,
  and <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\epsilon\)</alt></inlineequation> is the linear
  geometric strain,
  <equation id="Eqn-linear-strain">
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ \epsilon_{ij} = \frac12\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}
      + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}\right). \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  This form of the strain is <emphasis>not</emphasis> invariant under
  rigid rotations and is inappropriate for problems with large
  strains, which should use large strain elastic properties instead.
