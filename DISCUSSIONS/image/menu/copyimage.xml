<para>
  Copy an &image;, possibly into a different &micro;.
</para>
<para>
  The &micro; named by the <varname>microstructure</varname>
  parameter is the destination &micro;, to which the &image; will be
  copied.  If the destination &micro; is not the &micro; in which
  the source &image; resides, then it must have the same physical
  and pixel <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Coordinates">sizes</link>
  as the &image;.  If the destination &micro; does not already
  exist, then it will be created.  The new &micro; will have the
  same sizes as the &micro; containing the &image; being copied.
</para>
<para>
  If the given <varname>name</varname> for the copied &image; is not
  unique in the destination &micro;, then it will be made unique by
  appending <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput>, where
  <userinput>x</userinput> is an integer.
