<para>
  Select a contiguous set of pixels by dragging out a rectangle with
  the mouse.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>source</varname> parameter is the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to a &micro; or
  &image;.  If it's an &image;, the selection is made in the &micro;
  in which the &image; resides.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>points</varname> parameter is a <link
  linkend="Object-list">Python list</link> of <link
  linkend="Object-Point"><classname>Points</classname></link> in the
  &micro;, indicating the mouse motion.  It should contain just two
  points, at diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle.  If the
  list contains more than two points, only the first and last will
  be used.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
  parameters govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>1</userinput>) or not (<userinput>0</userinput>) the
  shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
  initiated this command.
