  Disable the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solvers">solution</link> of the given
  &subproblem;.  It can later be re-enabled by <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Subproblem.Enable_Solution"/>.  When solving
  multiple &subproblems;, disabling a solution is a quick way to
  prevent a &subproblem; from being solved, if deleting the solver
  entirely isn't desired.
