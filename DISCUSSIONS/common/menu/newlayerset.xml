  <para>
    Make a new &layerset; for drawing something in a Graphics window.
    This really just resets the &layereditor;, and sets its
    <varname>Destination</varname> to the specified Graphics window.  It
    doesn't affect the Graphics window until the &layerset; is <link
    linkend='MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Send'>sent</link> to
    the window.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because the <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Send"><command>Send</command></link>
    overwrites the currently selected &layer; in a Graphics window, the
    <command>New</command> command deselects all &layers; in the
    Destination window.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the GUI, this command can be invoked either from the
    <guimenuitem>New...</guimenuitem> menu item in the
    <guimenu>Layer</guimenu> menu in any Graphics window, or from the
    <guibutton>New...</guibutton> button in the &layereditor; window
    itself.
