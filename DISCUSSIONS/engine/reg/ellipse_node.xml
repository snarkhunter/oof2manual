<para>
  <command>EllipseNodeSelect</command> is a <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Select_Node">selection
  method</link> that selects &nodes; in response to a mouse click in
  the <link linkend="Chapter-Graphics">graphics window</link> when the
  <link linkend="Section-Graphics-SkeletonSelection">Skeleton
  Selection</link> toolbox is active and is set to <quote>Node</quote>
  mode.  It selects all &nodes; lying within a ellipse swept out by
  dragging the mouse, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Figure-ellipse_nodes"/>.  The ellipse is defined by the
  rectangle that bounds it.  Click the mouse on one corner of the
  rectangle and drag to the diagonally opposite corner.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>skeleton</varname> is the &skel; from which the &nodes; are
  to be selected.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>points</varname> is a <xref linkend="Object-list"/> of
  <xref linkend="Object-Point"/> objects.  The first point in the list
  is one corner of the rectangle bounding the ellipse, and the last
  point is the diagonally opposite corner. Any other points in the
  list will be ignored.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname> parameters
  govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of &nodes; defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the &nodes;
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>1</userinput>) or not (<userinput>0</userinput>) the
  shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
  initiated this command.
