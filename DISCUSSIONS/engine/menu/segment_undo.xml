  <para>
    Each &skel; maintains a stack of previous &sgmt; selections.
    Whenever &sgmts; are selected or deselected, a new
    version is pushed onto the stack.  The <command>Undo</command>
    pops the latest version off of the stack, thereby reverting to the
    previously selected set of &sgmts;.  The popped set is not
    destroyed -- it can be recovered with the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.SegmentSelection.Redo"/> command.
  </para>
  <para>
    The selection stack is not infinite.  When it is full, the oldest
    selection will be lost when a new selection is made.
