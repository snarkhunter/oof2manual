<para>
  When an &elem; is modified or a &node; is moved, it affects its
  neighboring &elems;, causing changes in their effective <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Energy">element energy</link>.
  When the <classname>AverageEnergy</classname>
  <varname>criterion</varname> is applied to a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier"/>, &oof2; accepts a
  modification only if it lowers the average effective energy of all
  of the affected &elems;.  If more than one modification is being
  considered,<footnote>
  <para>
	This does not mean that all possible node moves are considered for
	<link linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifiers</link>
	that choose from an infinite number of possibilities, like <xref
	linkend="RegisteredClass-Anneal"/> does.  It only applies to
	modifiers that sometimes have a finite number of choices to make,
	such as <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SnapNodes"/>.
  </para></footnote>
  the one that lowers the energy the most is accepted.
</para>
<para>
  The parameter <varname>alpha</varname> plays a critical role, since
  it controls how the effective <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Energy">energy</link> is computed
  for each element.  Take the node move shown in <xref
  linkend="Figure-average_example"/> for example.

<para>
  This node move will lower the total <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homog_Energy">homogeneity
  energy</link> by 0.12 but it will elevate the total <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Shape_Energy">shape energy</link>
  by 0.53.  If <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homog_Energy">homogeneity
  energy</link> and <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Shape_Energy">shape energy</link>
  are to be equally considered (<varname>alpha</varname> = 0.5), the
  move will not be accepted by the
  <classname>AverageEnergy</classname> criterion &#x2014; it increases
  the overall energy level.  The move becomes possible only if
  <varname>alpha</varname> is greater than 0.82.
