<para>
  <command>ExpandNodeSelection</command> selects nodes by selecting
  the neighbors of the currently selected &nodes;.  The
  <varname>criterion</varname> parameter determines exactly which
  other &nodes; are considered to be neighbors.
</para>
<para>
  Expanding the &node; selection is useful when applying &skel; <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifier</link> to a
  portion of a &skel;.  For example, to improve the resolution of a
  boundary in a &micro;, it's convenient to <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Anneal"/> the &nodes; that are close to the
  boundary.  To do this, select the &nodes; on the boundary, expand
  the selection, and then <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Anneal"/> the
  selected &nodes;.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>criterion</varname> parameter determines which
  addtional &nodes; are selected.  If it's set to <userinput>By
  Elements</userinput>, all &nodes; that share an &elem; with a
  currently selected &node; are selected.  If it's set to
  <userinput>By Segments</userinput>, all &nodes; that share a &sgmt;
  with a selected &node; are selected.  The difference is illustrated
  in <xref linkend="Figure-expandnodeselection"/>.
