<para>
  The values of the <varname>Displacement</varname> &field; are
  usually found by solving the <xref
  linkend="Equation-Force_Balance"/> &equation;.  Its conjugate &flux;
  is <xref linkend="Flux-Stress"/>.
</para>
<para>
  The <link linkend='Section-Concepts-Mesh-3D'>in-plane</link>
  <varname>Displacement</varname> &field; has two components,
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(u_x\)</alt></inlineequation> and

  companion <link

  <varname>Displacement_z</varname>, has three components,
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\partial u_z/\partial
