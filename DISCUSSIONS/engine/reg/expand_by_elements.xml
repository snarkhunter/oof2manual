<para>
  <classname>ExpandByElements</classname> is used as the
  <varname>criterion</varname> parameter of <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.NodeSelection.Expand_Node_Selection"/>.  It
  expands the current &node; selection by selecting all &nodes; that
  share an &elem; with a &node; that is already selected.  When a
  &skel; contains quadrilateral &elems;,
  <classname>ExpandByElements</classname> may select more &nodes; than
  its colleague <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ExpandBySegments"/>
  will.  See <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.NodeSelection.Expand_Node_Selection"/> for an
  illustration.
