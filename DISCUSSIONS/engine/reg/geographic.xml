<para>
  <classname>GeographicQ2T</classname> is a <xref

</para>
<para>
  An interior quadrilateral has four neighboring &elems;.  If it has
  two neighbors of one type (defined by their dominant <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-PixelCategory">pixel category</link>) and
  two of another, arranged as in <xref
  linkend="Figure-split_pattern"/>(a), and if the &elem; itself is
  inhomogeneous, then there's a chance that dividing it along the
  diagonal shown in <xref linkend="Figure-split_pattern"/>(b) will
  improve the homogeneity of the &skel;.

	    e<subscript>2</subscript>, and e<subscript>3</subscript>.  The
	    central element is a candidate for splitting with
	    <classname>GeographicQ2T</classname> because
	    e<subscript>0</subscript> and e<subscript>1</subscript> have
	    the same category, and e<subscript>2</subscript> and

        (c) In this example <classname>GeographicQ2T</classname> fails
        to split the central element correctly, even though the
        e<subscript>0</subscript> and e<subscript>1</subscript> have
        the same pixel category (pink) and e<subscript>2</subscript>
        and e<subscript>3</subscript> have the same category (white).
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        (d) Dividing along the geographical boundary has created two
        inhomogeneous &elems;.  This modification will be rejected
        unless it was done with a very small <varname>alpha</varname>.

<para>
  <classname>GeographicQ2T</classname> can be fast because it only
  examines quads with a high likelihood of being splittable.  However,
  it can skip over splittable quads if the &skel; is not already
  sufficiently refined and one of the neighbors has the wrong
  type. <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-TrialAndErrorQ2T"/> is slower
  but more thorough.
