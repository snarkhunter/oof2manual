  <para>
    <classname>SampleSet</classname> objects are part of the
    post-solution <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework, in
    which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
    <classname>SampleSet</classname> determines how data is extracted
    from the sampling <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"/>.  When
    <varname>sampling</varname> is set to
    <classname>ElementSegmentSampleSet</classname>, data is extracted
    from evenly spaced points within a linear
    <classname>Domain</classname> on an element by element basis.
    This guarantees that some sampling points lie within each &elem;
    crossed by the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <classname>ElementSegmentSampleSet</classname> belongs to the
    <link linkend="Sampling-bentline">bent line</link> SampleSet category.
  </para>
  <para>
    <varname>n_points</varname> determines the number of points along
    the line within each &elem;.  The point spacing within each
    Element is determined by the length of the intersection of the
    line and the Element.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>show_distance</varname> parameter governs whether or
    not the distance of each point from the beginning of the cross
    section will be displayed along with the
    data. <varname>show_fraction</varname> is similar, but the
    distance displayed will be divided by the total length of the
    line.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>show_x</varname> and <varname>show_y</varname>
    parameters govern whether the <emphasis>x</emphasis> and
    <varname>y</varname> positions of the points will be displayed along
    with the data.
  </para>
