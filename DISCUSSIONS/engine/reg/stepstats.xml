<para>
  <classname>StepStatistics</classname> is a dubiously useful <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/> that gathers statistics
  on the number and size of the time steps taken when <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Solver">solving</link> a time dependent
  problem.  Since the same statistics are automatically printed to the
  <link linkend="Section-Windows-Messages">Messages Window</link>
  after every solution, this class is only useful if for some reason
  you need those numbers saved in a file.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>StepStatistics</classname> doesn't produce any output
  until the time evolution is complete.  However, it does need to be
  invoked at intermediate times so that it can accumulate statistics.
  This is done by setting <varname>scheduletype</varname> to <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ConditionalOutputSchedule"/> and
  <varname>schedule</varname> to <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-EveryTime"/> in <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Schedule.Set"/>.
</para>
