  <para>
    Save the contents of the <link linkend='Chapter-Graphics'>Graphics
    window</link> in a PDF file.  The format is PDF-1.4. 
    Everything in the window is saved, not just
    what's visible in the scrolling region.<footnote>
      <simpara>
	This will be fixed in a later version.

    <para>
      This <command>Save</command> command is <emphasis>not</emphasis>
      the same as the <command>Save/Image</command> command in the
      <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.File"/> menu.  This command only
      writes PDF files, and includes everything that's being
      displayed.  <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.File.Save.Image"/> saves
      only a single &image; object, but can save it in many different
      formats.
