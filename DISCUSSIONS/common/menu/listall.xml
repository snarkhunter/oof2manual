<para>
  The <link linkend="Section-Graphics-LayerList">Layer list</link> in
  the <link linkend="Chapter-Graphics">Graphics</link> window usually
  only shows the primary &layers;: those that show &images;, &skels;,
  and &meshes;.  It does not show the predefined &layers; for <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Pixel_Selection">pixel selections</link>,
  <link linkend="Section-Tasks-SkeletonSelection">Skeleton
  selections</link>, &actives;, <foreignphrase>etc</foreignphrase>.
  In order to <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Edit">modify</link> (or <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Delete">delete</link>) the
  predefined layers in the GUI, it's necessary first to <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Select">select</link> them.
  In order to select them, it's necessary to turn on
  <command>List_All_Layers</command>.
</para>
<para>
  <command>List_All_Layers</command> has no effect in scripts or in
  text mode.  In GUI mode, unlisted layers are indicated by thin
  horizontal lines in the layer list, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Figure-unlisted"/>.

        The top image shows the Graphics Window's Layer List when
        <command>List_All_Layers</command> is off.  The arrows mark
        the faint lines denoting the unlisted &layers;.  The bottom
        image shows a portion of the list when
        <command>List_All_Layers</command> is on.  It is necessary to
        scroll to see the whole list.  Most of the &layers;
        are predefined auxiliary &layers; not normally displayed.  At
        this position in the list, only one of the normally listed
        layers (indicated by the pink box) is visible.
