  Maps of different origins have different formats, which are
  generally poorly documented.  The vendor-specific subclasses defined
  here have worked at some time in the past, but are not guaranteed to
  work now.  The <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-GenericReader"/> lets
  you enter information about the format and hopefully will work on
  any file not covered by the specific readers.
