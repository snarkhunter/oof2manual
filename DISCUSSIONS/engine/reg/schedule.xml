<para>
  Subclasses of <classname>Schedule</classname> are used by the
  commands in the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Schedule"/> menu and the
  <link linkend="Section-Tasks-ScheduledOutput">Scheduled
  Output</link> page to set the times at which <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Outputs</link> will be performed during a time evolution
  computation.  The actual times depend on both the
  <classname>Schedule</classname> and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduleType"/> that are assigned to the
  <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">Scheduled
  Output</link> by the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Scheduled_Output.Schedule.Set"/> command.
  Some <classname>Schedule</classname>s are appropriate only for
  particular <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduleType"/>s.  The GUI
  prevents incompatible combinations from being used.
