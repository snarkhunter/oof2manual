<para>
  <classname>ExpandBySegments</classname> is used as the
  <varname>criterion</varname> parameter of <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.NodeSelection.Expand_Node_Selection"/>.  It
  expands the current &node; selection by selecting all &nodes; that
  share a &sgmt; with a &node; that is already selected.  When a
  &skel; contains quadrilateral &elems;,
  <classname>ExpandBySegments</classname> may select fewer &nodes;
  than its colleague <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ExpandByElements"/> will.  See <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.NodeSelection.Expand_Node_Selection"/> for an
  illustration.
