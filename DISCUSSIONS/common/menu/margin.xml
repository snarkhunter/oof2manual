<para>
  Zooming to <link
  linkend='MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Settings.Zoom.Fill_Window'>full
  size</link> leaves a blank margin around the display.  The given
  <varname>fraction</varname> specifies the width of the margin, as
  a fraction of the total display size.  If the canvas and its
  contents do not have the same aspect ratio, the margins will be
  unequal, and the setting applies to the smaller dimension.
