<para>
  This command converts an <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-OrientationMap"><classname>Orientation
  Map</classname></link> into an &image;, and loads the &image; into
  the map's &micro;.  This is useful if you'd like to view the map in
  a graphics window or use color-dependent pixel selection tools on
  the data in the map.  Those tools only work on &images;.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>microstructure</varname> parameter specifies which
  <classname>Orientation Map</classname> to convert.  &micros; can
  contain only one <classname>Orientation Map</classname>, so
  specifying the &micro; name is sufficient.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>imagename</varname> parameter holds the name that will
  be assigned to the new &image;.  If the name is not unique,
  <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput> will be appended to it, where
  <userinput>x</userinput> is a suitable integer.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>colorscheme</varname> parameter governs how
  orientations in the map will be converted to pixels in the &image;.
  If most of the orientations in the <classname>Orientation
  Map</classname> are similar, the resulting &image; will have very
  low contrast.  It may be useful to use image modification tools,
  especially <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Modify.Equalize"/>, to
  enhance the contrast.
</para>
<note>
  <para>
    There is no 100% satisfactory way of converting orientations to
    colors.  The topology of orientation space is different from the
    topology of color space so the conversion is either discontinuous
    or not one-to-one.
