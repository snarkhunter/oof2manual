<para>
  <classname>DataOperation</classname> subclasses represent the
  operations that can performed on data produced by the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs">Output</link> classes when <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Analysis">analyzing results</link>, or
  computing <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs-Scheduled">scheduled
  outputs</link>.  They're used in a slightly confusing fashion in
  scripts.  For scheduled outputs, they appear as the
  <varname>operation</varname> parameter in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BulkAnalysis"/> objects, but for Analysis
  operations, each <classname>DataOperation</classname> is converted
  into a menu item. For example, the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AverageOutput"/> subclass corresponds to
  the menu command <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze.Average"/>.
