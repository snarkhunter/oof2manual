<para>
  <command>OOF.SegmentSelection.Select_From_Selected_Elements</command>
  provides three ways of selecting &sgmts; based on a pre-existing
  &elem; selection.  The two parameters <varname>internal</varname>
  and <varname>boundary</varname> control which &sgmts; will be
  selected.  If <varname>internal</varname> is true, then the &sgmts;
  that are shared by exactly two selected &elems; will be selected.
  If <varname>boundary</varname> is true, then the &sgmts; that are
  part of only one selected &elem; will be selected.
