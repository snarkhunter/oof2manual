<para>
  When <command>Hide_Empty_Mesh_Elements</command> is on, &elems; of a
  &mesh; which have no assigned &material; are not drawn by any <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-DisplayMethod"/>.  Some display methods,
  such as <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-FilledContourDisplay"/>,
  never draw these elements in any case, even if
  <command>Hide_Empty_Mesh_Elements</command> is off.
</para>
<note>
  <para>
    The default value of <command>Hide_Empty_Mesh_Elements</command>
    is <userinput>True</userinput>.  If a &mesh; doesn't appear in the
    graphics window, ensure that the elements aren't empty, or that
    empty elements are being shown.
