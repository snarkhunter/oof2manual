  The <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_method"
  role="external">Forward Euler method</ulink> is the simplest method
  of numerically integrating ordinary differential equations. The
  individual steps are very quick to compute, but the method is often
  unstable, requiring very small step sizes.  It is first order in
  time, meaning that it makes an error of order <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\( (\Delta t)^2 \) </alt></inlineequation> on each step.
</para>
<para>
  Given a vector <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\phi_n\)</alt></inlineequation> of unknowns
  (<foreignphrase>i.e.</foreignphrase> &field; values in &oof2;) at
  time <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(t_n\)</alt></inlineequation>,
  and the first order differential equation
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ \frac{d\phi}{dt} = f(\phi, t) \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  the Forward Euler estimate for <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(\phi_{n+1}\)</alt></inlineequation> is
  <equation id="Eqn-ForwardEuler">
    <alt role="tex"> 
      \[ \phi_{n+1} = \phi_n + \Delta t f(\phi_n, t_n) \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\( \Delta t = t_{n+1}-t_n
  \)</alt></inlineequation>.
 </para>
<para>
   <classname>ForwardEuler</classname> can be applied to equations
   with second order time derivatives
   <equation>
     <alt role="tex">
       \[ \frac{d^2\phi}{dt^2} = g(\phi, t) \]
     </alt>
   </equation>
   by defining new variables
   <equation>
     <alt role="tex">
       \[ \psi = \frac{d\phi}{dt} \]
     </alt>
   </equation>
   and solving the augmented set of first order equations
   <equation id="Eqn-Augmented">
     <alt role="tex">
       \begin{align*}
       \frac{d\psi}{dt} &amp;= g(\phi, t) \\
       \frac{d\phi}{dt} &amp;= \psi
       \end{align*}
     </alt>
   </equation>
</para>
<para>
  <classname>ForwardEuler</classname> works equally well for linear
  and nonlinear equations.  Because the method is explicit, equation
  <xref linkend="Eqn-ForwardEuler"/> doesn't require a <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-NonlinearSolverBase">nonlinear
  solver</link> even if <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(f\)</alt></inlineequation> is nonlinear.
