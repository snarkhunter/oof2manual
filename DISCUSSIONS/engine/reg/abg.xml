  <para>
    An <classname>Abg</classname> object represents the orientation of
    a three dimensional object (assumed to be a crystal in this
    discussion) in three dimensional space in terms of the Euler
    angles
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\((\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>.  The literature contains different ways of
    interpreting the angles.  Here we present four different, but
    equivalent, prescriptions for determining the actual rotation
    described by the three angles, as used in the
    <classname>Abg</classname> class.
  </para>
  <para>
    We define <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\((\hat{\mathrm{\bf x}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf y}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf z}})\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    to be the screen coordinate system, with &xhat; pointing to the
    right, &yhat; upwards, and &zhat; out of the screen.  We will call
    the crystal axes
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\((\hat{\mathrm{\bf a}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf b}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf c}})\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>.
    As usual, all rotations are right handed &#x2014; a positive rotation
    about an axis is counterclockwise if the axis is pointed towards
    you.
  </para>

  <formalpara><title>One Method of Finding the Euler Angles:</title>
    <para>
      This method describes the rotation that must be applied to the
      crystal axes to bring them into alignment with the screen axes,
      assuming that the crystal <emphasis>starts</emphasis> in its
      desired orientation with respect to the screen. First, rotate
      the axes by &beta; around the &chat; axis.  This defines new axes
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\((\hat{\mathrm{\bf a'}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf b'}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf c}})\) </alt>
      </inlineequation>.
      Next rotate by &alpha; about the 
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\(\hat{\mathrm{\bf b'}}\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>
      axis, defining another coordinate system
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\((\hat{\mathrm{\bf a''}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf b'}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf c''}})\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>.
      Finally, rotate by &gamma; about the
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\(\hat{\mathrm{\bf c''}}\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>
      axis, bringing the axes into agreement with
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\((\hat{\mathrm{\bf x}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf y}}, \hat{\mathrm{\bf z}})\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>.
    </para>
  </formalpara>
  
  
  <formalpara>
    <title>An equivalent method:</title>
    <para>
      Consider the material oriented with a globe, with the origin at
      the center of the earth and &chat;-axis pointing towards the
      north pole, the &ahat;-axis pointing at the Greenwich Meridian
      where it intersects the equator and the &bhat;-axis pointing
      towards the Indian ocean somewhere southeast of Sri Lanka.  The
      unrotated globe has its &ahat;, &bhat;, and &chat; axes aligned
      with the &xhat;, &yhat;, and &zhat; axes of the screen,
      respectively.  The rotation triplet describes how to rotate the
      material into its desired orientation (in contrast to the
      previous method, which <emphasis>started</emphasis> with the
      material in its desired orientation). The first number of the
      rotation triplet tilts the point on the north pole southward
      along the Greenwich Meridian by -&alpha; degrees to a new
      latitude.  The second number spins the globe to the east by
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\(-\beta\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>
      degrees about its (tilted) &chat;-axis. The third number
      rotates the tilted globe to the east by <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\(-\gamma\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>
      degrees about the screen's &zhat; axis.
    </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
    <title>A third method:</title>
    <para>
      The order of rotations in the previous definition can be
      rearranged. Rotate the globe to the east by <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\(-\beta\)</alt>
      </inlineequation> degrees about
      the &zhat;-axis, tilt the north pole by <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\(-\alpha\)</alt>
      </inlineequation> about the
      &yhat;-axis, and rotate to the east by <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\(-\gamma\)</alt>
      </inlineequation> again about the
      &zhat;-axis.
    </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
    <title>The fourth method:</title>
    <para>
      If you know the components in the crystal coordinate system of
      the screen vectors &xhat;, &yhat;, and &zhat;, you can compute
      the Euler angles as follows. Let
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\((x_1, x_2, x_3)\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>
      be the components of the screen's &xhat;-axis in the crystal
      coordinate system. Let
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\((y_1, y_2, y_3)\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>
      and
      <inlineequation>
	<alt role="tex">\((z_1, z_2, z_3)\)</alt>
      </inlineequation>
      similarly be the components of the &yhat; and &zhat;-axes. Then
      <informalequation>
	<alt role="tex">
	  \begin{align*}
	  \sin(\alpha) &amp;= \sqrt{z_1^2 + z_2^2} \\
	  \cos(\alpha) &amp;= z_3 \\
	  \\
	  \sin(\beta) &amp;= z_2/\sqrt{z_1^2 + z_2^2} \\
	  \cos(\beta) &amp;= z_1/\sqrt{z_1^2 + z_2^2} \\
	  \\
	  \sin(\gamma) &amp;= y_3/\sqrt{z_1^2 + z_2^2} \\
	  \cos(\gamma) &amp;= -x_3/\sqrt{z_1^2 + z_2^2} \\
	  \end{align*}
	</alt>
      </informalequation>
    </para>
  </formalpara>
