  then converts the grayscale image to black and white, according to
  the given <varname>method</varname>, which is a object from the

<para>
  Previous versions of &oof2; had a <command>ThresholdImage</command>
  command, which was equivalent to the new
  <command>Threshold</command> command with <varname>method</varname>
  set to <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ManualThreshold"/>.  The old
  command is still recognized in scripts but cannot be invoked via the
  GUI.
