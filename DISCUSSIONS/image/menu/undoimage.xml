  <para>
    Each &image; in a &micro; has associated with it a stack of
    modified versions of the &image;.  When the &image; is <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Modify">modified</link>, the new
    version is pushed onto the stack.  The <command>Undo</command>
    command pops the topmost version off the stack, thereby reverting
    to the next older version.  The popped version is not destroyed,
    however.  It can be recovered with <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.Redo"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The &image; stack has a limited depth.  When the stack is full,
    the oldest versions of an &image; will be lost when new
    modifications are made.
