<para>
  Automatically assign every &active; pixel in the &micro; to a
  &pixelgroup; according to a given criterion.  Unlike <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Image.AutoGroup"/>, this command is designed
  to handle noisy images (but not too noisy), and it can group pixels
  according to <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-OrientationMap">EBSD</link>
  data as well as color.
</para>
<para>
  There are three steps in the process:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	<command>AutoGroup</command> keeps track of the mean and
	standard deviation of the groups that it's creating.  It
	selects a pixel at random and sees if that pixel's value is
	within <varname>delta</varname> standard deviations of the
	mean of any existing pixel group (where "existing" means any
	of the groups already created during this call to
	<command>AutoGroup</command>).  If it is, then the pixel is
	added to the group and the group's mean and deviation are
	recomputed.  If the pixel is close to the mean of more than
	one group, the closest one is used.  After recomputing the
	mean, the group is compared to all other groups, and if it's
	within <varname>gamma</varname> deviations of one, the two
	groups are merged.  Again, if more than one is found, the
	closest one is used.  The mean and deviation of the merged
	group is recomputed and checked against the remaining groups
	recursively until no more merges are found.
      </para>
      <para>
	If the pixel being examined is not within
	<varname>delta</varname> standard deviations of any group, a
	new group is created for it, and a standard deviation of
	<varname>sigma0</varname> is imposed.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	After putting pixels into preliminary groups, each group is
	split into contiguous pieces, where each piece is a single
	connected set of pixels.  Any sets containing fewer than
	<varname>minsize</varname> pixels are absorbed into the
	neighboring groups.  If there are multiple groups neighboring
	a pixel, the pixel is added to the group with the nearest
	mean, measured in terms of the group's standard deviation.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	If the parameter <varname>contiguous</varname> is
	<userinput>false</userinput>, the groups that were split in
	the previous step are reassembled, so the final &pixelgroups;
	may be discontiguous.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
	Finally, the groups are sorted by size, largest to smallest,
	and each group is given a name, determined by the
	<varname>name_template</varname> parameter.  A
	<userinput>%n</userinput> in the name will be replaced by an
	integer, starting from 0.  If <varname>name_template</varname>
	does not contain <userinput>%n</userinput>, one will be
	appended to it.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>
