<para>
  <classname>SampleSet</classname> objects are part of the
  post-solution <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework, in
  which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"><classname>Domain</classname></link>
  is the subset of the &mesh; to which the sampling is applied. The
  <classname>SampleSet</classname> determines how samples are taken
  within the domain.
</para>
<para>
  Most of the <classname>SampleSet</classname> subclasses 
  come in two versions.  The version whose name begins with
  <classname>Stat</classname> is used when the data is going to be
  sent through a statistical function.  The other version is used when
  the data will be sent directly to the screen or a file.  The two
  versions are identical, except that the direct output version has
  additional parameters that govern which auxiliary data will be
  displayed.  These additional parameters all have names beginning
  with <varname>show_</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  Not all kinds of <classname>SampleSet</classname> are appropriate
  for all kinds of <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"><classname>Domains</classname></link>.
  The reference page for each type of <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"/> says which categories of
  <classname>SampleSets</classname> it is compatible with.  The
  categories are:
  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry id="Sampling-point">
	  <term>point</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Data is evaluated at individual points within the domain.</para>
	  </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry id="Sampling-pixel">
	  <term>pixel</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Data is evaluated at the centers of pixels.</para>
	  </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry id="Sampling-element">
	  <term>element</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Data is integrated over the area of &mesh; &elems;.</para>
	  </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry id="Sampling-line">
	  <term>line</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Data is evaluated at points along a line.</para>
	  </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry id="Sampling-bentline">
	  <term>bent line</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Data is evaluated along a joined set of line segments.</para>
	  </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
  </variablelist>
</para>
