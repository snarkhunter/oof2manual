<para>
  <classname>MergeTriangles</classname> merges two triangular &elems;
  into one quadrilateral &elem;.  It is more or less the opposite of
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SplitQuads"/>, which splits a
  quadrilateral into two triangles.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>targets</varname> parameter specifies which &elems; in
  the &skel; to examine.  Taking the &elems; in random order, &oof2;
  tries to merge each &elem; with <emphasis>each</emphasis> of its
  neighbor elements in turn (whether or not they're in the target
  list), if the neighbor is a triangle and has the same <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-PixelCategory">dominant pixel type</link>
  as the target &elem;.  The <varname>criterion</varname> parameter
  specifies which, if any, of the possible merges to accept.
</para>
<para>
  If a &mesh; is going to be built from <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Geometry">high-order</link> elements,
  merging the triangles in its &skel; reduces the overall degrees of
  freedom in the &mesh;, thereby decreasing the solution time (and
  possibly accuracy). For &meshes; made of linear elements (4-noded
  quads or 3-noded triangles) merging triangles does not reduce the
  number of degrees of freedom.
</para>
<para>
  <xref linkend="Figure-merge"/>(a) shows a few highlighted
  triangle pairs to be merged. The resulting &skel; is shown in
  <xref linkend="Figure-merge"/>(b).
