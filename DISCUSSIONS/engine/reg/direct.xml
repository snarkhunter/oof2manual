    The <classname>Direct</classname> solver uses <ulink
    url="http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/LUDecomposition.html"
    role="external">LU decomposition</ulink> to solve a matrix
    equation.  This method is <emphasis>not</emphasis> an iterative
    method, so there is no tolerance to specify.  However, it uses a
    lot of memory because it must store the whole matrix, even the
    zero components.  The iterative solvers are usually more
    appropriate for finite element matrices, which are generally
    sparse.
