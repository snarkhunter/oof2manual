<para>
  Copy an existing &mesh;.  The new &mesh; has the same &skel; and
  &micro; as the old &mesh;, as well as the same <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Geometry">types of finite
  elements</link>.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>copy_field</varname> is true, then the new &mesh; will
  have the same defined and active &fields; as the original &mesh;,
  and the &fields; will have the same values.  If
  <varname>copy_field</varname> is false, then no &fields; will be
  defined in the new &mesh;.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>copy_equation</varname> is true, then all &equations;
  that are active in the old &mesh; will be active in the new &mesh;.
  If it is false, then no equations will be active in the new &mesh;.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>copy_bc</varname> is true, then <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition">boundary
  conditions</link> will be copied from the old &mesh; to the new.  It
  it is false, the new &mesh; will not have any boundary conditions.
  It <emphasis>will</emphasis> have <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundaries</link>,
  though, because boundaries are defined in the &skel;.
