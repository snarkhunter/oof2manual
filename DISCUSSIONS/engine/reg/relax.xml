  <para>
    <classname>Relax</classname> is a &skel; <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifier</link> that
    moves &nodes; to improve &elem; homogeneity and shape.  In spirit
    it's like a deterministic version of <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Anneal"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
    <varname>Relax</varname> works by giving each &elem; an isotropic
    elastic modulus and an elastic driving force with two components.
    The first component is isotropic and proportional to the &elem;'s
    <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homog_Energy">homogeneity
      energy</link>.<footnote>
      <para>
	Actually, we use
	<inlineequation>
	  <alt role="tex">\(E_\mathrm{homogeneity}(1+E_\mathrm{homogeneity})\)</alt>
	</inlineequation>
	to provide a stronger disincentive to very badly shaped
	&elems;.
      </para>
    </footnote>
    This causes inhomogeneous elements to shrink.  The
    second part is anisotropic and proportional to the traceless part
    of the &elem;'s moment of inertia tensor.  This drives the &elems;
    shapes toward squares and equilateral triangles.  The relative
    weight of the two terms is given by <varname>alpha</varname>.
  </para>
  <para>
    One iteration of the <varname>Relax</varname> algorithm is
    equivalent to taking one Euler time step of the equation
    <equation>
      <alt role="tex">
	\[
	\frac{du}{dt} = \gamma\nabla\cdot\sigma
	\]
      </alt>
    </equation>
    where <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\sigma\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    is the stress and
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">u</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    is the displacement of a
    &node;.  After each step, the driving force is recomputed.  The
    parameter <varname>gamma</varname> plays the role of a &node;
    mobility.  Using a large <varname>gamma</varname> will make the
    &skel; change faster but will risk moving &nodes; too far and
    overstepping their optimal positions.
