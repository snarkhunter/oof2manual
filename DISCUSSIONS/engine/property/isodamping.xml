<para>
  This &property; adds a term proportional to the time derivative of
  the <xref linkend="Field-Displacement"/> to the <xref
  linkend="Equation-Force_Balance"/> equation.  Specifically, it adds
  a contribution
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ -d \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  to the <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(C_{ij}\)</alt></inlineequation> term in Eq.&nbsp;<xref
  linkend="Eqn-Force_Balance"/>.  <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(d\)</alt></inlineequation> is a scalar given by the
  parameter <varname>damping</varname>.

<note>
  <para>
    This property is unphysical because it breaks Galilean invariance.
    It was added for debugging purposes.  It may, however, be useful
    to add stability to the numerical solution in some cases.
