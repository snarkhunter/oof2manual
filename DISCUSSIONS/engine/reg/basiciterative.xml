<para>
  <classname>BasicIterative</classname> is a <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solvers-Matrix">matrix equation
  solver</link> used in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/>.  It uses the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ConjugateGradient"/> method for symmetric
  matrices and the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-StabilizedBiConjugateGradient"/> method for
  asymmetric matrices, both of which are iterative methods appropriate
  for large sparse matrices.  In both cases it preconditions the
  matrix with the <link
