  <para>
    Load a &layer; and its &layerset; into the &layereditor;.  When
    invoked from the <guimenuitem>Edit...</guimenuitem> menu item in
    the Graphics window's <guimenu>Layer</guimenu> menu, the currently
    selected &layer; will be loaded.  When invoked by double clicking
    in the <link linkend="Section-Graphics-LayerList">Layer
      List</link>, the clicked &layer; will be loaded.
  </para>
  <para>
    In the GUI, the &layereditor; will be opened and raised if
    necessary, the selected &layer; will be highlighted in the
    &layereditor;'s <guilabel>Display Methods</guilabel> pane, and the
    Graphics window from which the command originated will be chosen
    in the <guimenu>Destination</guimenu> menu.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      The <command>Edit</command> command only loads a
      <emphasis>copy</emphasis> of a &layerset; into the
      &layereditor;.  Despite its name, it doesn't actually modify any
      &layers;.  To modify a &layerset;, it's necessary to use the
      other commands in the <xref
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet"/> menu or the
      &layereditor; GUI and to <link
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Send"><command>Send</command></link>
      the &layerset; back to the Graphics window.
