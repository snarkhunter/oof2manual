<para>
  <classname>Domain</classname> objects are part of the
  post-solution analysis framework, in which useful data is
  extracted from the mesh.  You select an <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">operation</link> (like <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze.Direct_Output"/>, if you want
  to see the data, or <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze.Average"/>), a
  <classname>Domain</classname>, and a <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">Sampling</link>.
</para>
<para>
  The <classname>Domain</classname> is the subset of the &mesh; to
  which the sampling is applied.  All the samples thus generated
  will lie within the domain, or in some cases within the domain's
  bounding box.
</para>
<para>
  All domains are ways of specifying an area on the mesh, and differ
  in how this area is specified.  You may select an element group
  selection, a <link linkend="RegisteredClass-PixelGroup">pixel
  group or selection</link>, a <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshCrossSection">cross section</link>,
  or the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-EntireMesh">entire
  mesh</link>.  Exactly how the domain is interpreted by the output
  operation depends on the sampling.
