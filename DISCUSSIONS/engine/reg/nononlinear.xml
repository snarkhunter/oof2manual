<para>
  <classname>NoNonlinearSolver</classname> is the trivial <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-NonlinearSolverBase"/>.  When selecting a
  <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solvers">solver</link> in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/>, specifying
  <classname>NoNonlinearSolver</classname> as the
  <varname>nonlinear_solver</varname> parameter will cause &oof2; to
  assume that the &subproblem; is linear.
</para>
<para>
  Selecting <classname>NoNonlinearSolver</classname> for a nonlinear
  &subproblem; will lead to unpredictable results.  An explicit <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-TimeStepper">time stepper</link>, such as
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ForwardEuler"/> or <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-RK4"/> will still work, but other steppers
  will be unreliable.  Static solutions will be incorrect.
</para>
<para>
  In <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/>,
  <classname>NoNonlinearSolver</classname> is used automatically for
  linear problems.
