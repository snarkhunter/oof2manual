    In GUI mode, this command operates on the currently <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Select">selected</link>
    &layer;.  In text mode and in scripts, the &layer; is specified by
    its position <varname>n</varname> in the window's layer list.  The
    unlisted layers must be counted when computing
    <varname>n</varname>.  This command isn't very friendly in
    scripts, because it can be hard to determine <varname>n</varname>.
