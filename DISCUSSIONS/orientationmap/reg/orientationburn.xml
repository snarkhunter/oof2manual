<para>
  Select a contiguous set of similarly <emphasis>oriented</emphasis>
  pixels, using an algorithm sometimes used to model forest fires.
  This can be a powerful way of selecting features in a &micro;.  The
  process is identical to <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Pixel_Select.Burn"/> except that
  it works with <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Material-Orientation">orientations</link>
  instead of colors.  The pixels must have an <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Material-Orientation">Orientation</link>
  assigned to them.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>source</varname> parameter must be the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to an &image;.  The
  selection is made in the &micro; in which the &image; resides.
</para>
<para>
  The algorithm first selects the pixel located at the first <link
  linkend="Object-Point"><classname>Point</classname></link> in the
  <varname>points</varname> list. The selection spreads like a forest
  fire from one pixel to its neighbors, if the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Material-Orientation">misorientation</link>
  between the selected pixel and its neighbor is less than
  <varname>local_flammability</varname>, and the misorientation
  between the neighbor and the first point is less than
  <varname>global_flammability</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>next_nearest</varname> parameter determines whether
  the selection spreads diagonally from pixel to pixel in the
  &image;, or only along the x and y axes.  A burn started at one
  square on a checkerboard will spread to all the squares of the
  same color if <varname>next_nearest</varname> is
  <userinput>True</userinput>, but will not spread beyond the initial
  square if <varname>next_nearest</varname> is
  <userinput>False</userinput>.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
  parameters govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>) the
  shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
  initiated this command.
</para>
