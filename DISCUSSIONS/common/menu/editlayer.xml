<para>
  Replace the <userinput>n</userinput><superscript>th</superscript>
  &layer; of the canvas with a new one defined by
  <varname>category</varname>, <varname>what</varname>, and
  <varname>how</varname>.  Those parameters have the same meaning that
  they have in <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.New"/>.
</para>
<para>
  In the GUI, a &layer; can be edited by selecting it in the Layer
  List at the bottom of the Graphics Window and choosing
  <command>Edit</command> from the <guimenu>Layer</guimenu> menu, or
  by double clicking in the Layer List.  Either method will open a
  dialog box preloaded with the parameters describing layer number
  <varname>n</varname>.  All parameters other than
  <varname>n</varname> can be changed in the dialog.
</para>
<para>
  In text mode and in scripts, the &layer; is specified by its
  position <varname>n</varname> in the window's layer list.  The <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Settings.List_All_Layers">unlisted</link>
  and invisible layers must be counted when computing
  <varname>n</varname>.  This command isn't very friendly in scripts,
  because it can be hard to determine <varname>n</varname>.
