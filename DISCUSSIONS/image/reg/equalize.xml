<para>
  Apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization to an
  &image;.  This spreads out the distribution of pixel values to
  increase the contrast in the image.

<para>
  This routine uses <ulink
  url="https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.exposure.html#skimage.exposure.equalize_adapthist"
  role="external"><code>skimage.exposure.equalize_adapthist</code></ulink>
  from the &skimage; library.  The documentation
  describes it as "An algorithm for local contrast enhancement, that
  uses histograms computed over different tile regions of the
  image. Local details can therefore be enhanced even in regions that
  are darker or lighter than most of the image".  If operating on a
  color image, the image is converted to HSV, the method is applied to
  the V channel, and the image is converted back to RGB.
