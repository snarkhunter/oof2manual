  <para>
    This is a variation of the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Unconditional"/> and <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-LimitedAverageEnergy"/> criteria for
    accepting or rejecting &skel; <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifications</link>.
    As with <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Unconditional"/>, &skel;
    modifications are accepted whether or not they lower the average
    <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Energy">effective
    energy</link>, but, as with <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-LimitedAverageEnergy"/>, the
    modifications must satisfy certain constraints.  This criterion is
    best suited for putting finishing touches on the skeleton.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>homogeneity</varname> and
    <varname>shape_energy</varname> parameters are thresholds that
    <emphasis>each</emphasis> divide the &elems; into two classes:
    good (homogeneity above the threshold or <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Shape_Energy">shape
    energy</link> below the threshold), and bad (homogeneity below the
    threshold or shape energy above the threshold).  The rules for
    accepting a modification are that bad elements must not get worse
    and good elements may get worse, but may not cross the thresholds
    and become bad.
