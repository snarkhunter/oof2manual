<para>
  A &mesh; needs to be rebuilt if its &skel; changes in a way that
  changes the geometry of the &mesh;.  &meshes; are
  <emphasis>not</emphasis> rebuilt automatically when the &skel;
  changes, because rebuilding the &mesh; takes time, and the user may
  be planning more &skel; modifications.  After its &skel; has been
  modified, many &mesh; operations are prohibited until it has been
  rebuilt.
