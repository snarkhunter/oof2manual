<para>
  Using <classname>BasicAdaptiveDriver</classname> as the
  <varname>time_stepper</varname> in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/> tells &oof2; to <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solving">solve</link> a time
  dependent problem using adaptive stepping, in which the step size is
  adjusted to keep the estimated error below the given
  <varname>tolerance</varname>.  If that is not possible without using
  timesteps smaller than <varname>minstep</varname>, an error will be
  raised and the calculation will be aborted.
</para>
<para>
  Adaptive stepping requires more computation per step than <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicUniformDriver">uniform</link>
  stepping, but can be much more accurate and efficient, especially if
  the optimal step size changes during a calculation.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>BasicAdaptiveDriver</classname> automatically uses the
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-SS22"/> method with
  <code>theta1 = theta2 = 0.5</code>
  if the equations contain second order <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Time-Dependence">time derivatives</link>.
  It uses <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-CrankNicolson"/> otherwise.
  In both cases, the time step control and error estimation are
  handled by <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-TwoStep"/> and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AbsoluteErrorScaling"/>.
</para>
<para>
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AdaptiveDriver"/> plays the same role
  in <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/> that
  <classname>BasicAdaptiveDriver</classname> plays in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BasicSolverMode"/>.
