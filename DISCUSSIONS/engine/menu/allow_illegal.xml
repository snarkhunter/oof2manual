<para>
  When moving &nodes; manually with the <link
  linkend="Section-Graphics-MoveNodes">Move Nodes</link> toolbox, it
  can sometimes be necessary or convenient to temporarily create <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Illegality">illegal</link> &skel;
  &elems;.  Creating such &elems; is prohibited unless
  <command>AllowIllegal</command> has first been called with
  <varname>allowed</varname> set to 1.  Illegal &elems; will then be
  allowed until <command>AllowIllegal</command> is called with
  <varname>allowed</varname>=0.
