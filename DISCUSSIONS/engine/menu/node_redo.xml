  <para>
    Each &skel; maintains a stack of previous &node; selections.
    Whenever &nodes; are selected or deselected, a new version is
    pushed onto the stack.  The <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.NodeSelection.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>
    pops the latest version off of the stack, thereby reverting to the
    previously selected set of &nodes;.  The <command>Redo</command>
    command undoes the <command>Undo</command>, replacing the most
    recently popped selection onto the stack.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      Undone modifications can be redone only if no new &node;
      selections have been made since the time of the last <link
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.NodeSelection.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>.
