  <para>
    A <classname>Rodrigues</classname> object represents the
    orientation of a three dimensional object, assumed to be a
    crystal, in three dimensional space in terms of three parameters,
    representing the axis around which the rotation occurs, and the
    angle of the rotation.  This scheme resembles the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Axis"/> scheme, except that there is no
    explicit angle parameter, the angle being encoded in the magnitude
    of the vector.
  </para>
  <para>
    The physical rotation generated by the parameters brings the
    crystalline &ahat;, &bhat;, and &chat; axes into coincidence with
    the laboratory (or screen) axes &xhat;, &yhat;, and &zhat;
    respectively.  The rotation occurs around a line joining the
    origin to the point
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\((r_1, r_2, r_3)\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>, and the
    angle
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\theta\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    of the rotation is given by
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\tan(\theta/2)=r\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>, with
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(r\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    being the magnitude of the vector.
