<para>
  Neumann boundary conditions apply the normal component of a &flux;
  on a <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundary</link>.  (In
  mathematics, Neumann conditions usually fix the normal derivative of
  the unknown field at a boundary.  In &oof2;, &fluxes; are
  proportional to the derivatives of &fields;, so we've appropriated
  the term <quote>Neumann</quote>.)
</para>
<para>
  Neumann boundary conditions only apply to <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge">Edge</link>
  boundaries. An edge boundary is composed of a directed series of
  segments, and this direction determines the definition of the
  positive normal.  If a boundary goes counterclockwise around the
  perimeter of a &skel;, then its normal points outward.  That is, the
  unit vectors in the normal and tangent directions form a right
  handed coordinate system (see <xref linkend="Figure-normal"/>).
</para>
<para>
  Neumann boundary conditions are integrated over element edges, and
  are therefore insensitive to node density.  That is, adding nodes to
  a boundary without changing the boundary condition will not change
  the effect of the boundary condition.  Compare this to <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ForceBC">Generalized Force</link> boundary
  conditions, which are applied node by node and
  <emphasis>are</emphasis> sensitive to node density.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>profile</varname> parameter specifies the value of the
  normal component of the &flux; along the boundary.  The
  <varname>profile</varname> is divided into a number of components
  depending on the dimension of the &flux;. If the &flux; is a vector
  (<foreignphrase>e.g</foreignphrase>, heat flux) then its normal
  component is a scalar, and only one profile, <varname>p0</varname>,
  must be provided.  If the &flux; is a tensor flux
  (<foreignphrase>e.g</foreignphrase>, stress), then its normal
  component is a vector, and two in-plane profiles,
  <varname>p0</varname> and <varname>p1</varname>, must be provided.
  Profiles may be arbitrary functions of position, and are specified
  by providing a <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-ProfileXT"/> object.
  See <xref linkend="Object-FluxProfileSet"/> for details on how to
  specify multiple <classname>Profiles</classname>.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>normal</varname> parameter specifies how the profile
  components are to be interpreted when the flux normal is
  multidimensional.  If <varname>normal</varname> is
  <userinput>False</userinput>, then <varname>p0</varname> and
  <varname>p1</varname> are the x and y components of the flux normal
  in the lab coordinate system (x towards the right, y towards the
  top).  If <varname>normal</varname> is <userinput>True</userinput>,
  then <varname>p0</varname> and <varname>p1</varname> are the
  components of the flux in a <emphasis>local</emphasis> coordinate
  system with <varname>p0</varname> normal to the boundary and
  <varname>p1</varname> tangent to it.  This coordinate system changes
  from point to point on the boundary if the boundary is curved.  When
  the flux normal is a scalar, the <varname>normal</varname> parameter
  is ignored.
