<para>
  In a time dependent problem, the initial value of a <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-FloatBC">floating boundary
  condition</link> needs to be assigned, just like the initial value
  of a field.  The boundary condition is a function of position along
  the boundary with an unspecified time-dependent offset.  The
  <varname>initializer</varname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-FloatBCInitMethod"/> object that determines
  the initial value of the offset.  It can specify the minimum,
  maximum, or average value of the field on the boundary at the
  initial time.
