  <para>
    Copy the cross section named <varname>cross_section</varname> from
    the &mesh; named <varname>current</varname> to the &mesh; named
    <varname>mesh</varname>, giving the copy the name
    <varname>name</varname>.
  </para>
  <para>
    If the given <varname>name</varname> is not unique among all cross
    sections in the target &mesh;, the string
    <userinput>&lt;x&gt;</userinput> will be appended to it, where
    <userinput>x</userinput> is an integer chosen to make the name
    unique.  If the <varname>name</varname> is <link
    linkend="Object-automatic"><userinput>automatic</userinput></link>,
    a suitable (but boring) name will be generated.
  </para>
  <para>
    The source mesh (<varname>current</varname>) and the target mesh
    (<varname>mesh</varname>) need not be different.
  </para>
