  <para>
    The <command>All</command> command in the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Settings.UndoBuffer_Size.Skeleton_Selection"/>
    menu sets the size of all of the history buffers used when
    selecting objects in a &skel;. There are separate buffers used for
    selecting &elems;, &nodes;, and &sgmts;.  When a selection is
    modified, the previous <varname>size</varname> selections are
    preserved in the buffer, which allows the <command>Undo</command>
    and <command>Redo</command> commands to work.  Using a large
    <varname>size</varname> allows more operations to be undone, but
    uses more memory.

  <warning>
    <para>
      Reducing the buffer size can cause data loss.
