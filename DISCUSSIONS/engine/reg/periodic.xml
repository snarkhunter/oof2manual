<para>
  Periodic boundary conditions set the values of a component of a
  &field; on a periodic pair of exterior <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge">edge</link>
  boundaries to be the same.  One boundary condition applies to all
  components of a &field;.  The value for the
  <varname>boundary</varname> parameter must be a string containing
  the names of two boundaries that constitute a periodic pair: the
  appropriate <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Periodicity">periodicity</link>
  option must have been chosen when the &skel;was created in the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-Skeleton">Skeleton task page</link> and the
  directions of the boundaries must be opposite.  By default, the left
  and right boundaries will constitute a valid pair if
  <varname>left_right_periodicity</varname> was chosen when the
  skeleton is created, as will the top and bottom boundaries, if
  <varname>top_bottom_periodicity</varname> was chosen.  The GUI
  presents a pull down menu listing the legal strings, but users of
  the text interface will need to know the possible values.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>field</varname> and <varname>equation</varname>
  parameters are the same as those for <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-DirichletBC">Dirichlet</link> boundary
  conditions.  See that discussion for details.  Note that periodic
  boundary conditions do not have <varname>profile</varname> or
  component parameters.
