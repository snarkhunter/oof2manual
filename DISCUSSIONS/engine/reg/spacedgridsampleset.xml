<para>
  <classname>SampleSet</classname> objects are part of the
  post-solution <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework, in
  which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
  <classname>SampleSet</classname> determines how data is extracted
  from the sampling <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"/>.  When
  <varname>sampling</varname> is set to
  <classname>SpacedGridSampleSet</classname>, data is extracted from a
  rectangular grid of points in the <classname>Domain</classname>.
</para>
<para>
  The <classname>SpacedGridSampleSet</classname> belongs to the <link
  linkend="Sampling-point">point</link> SampleSet category.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>delta_x</varname> and <varname>delta_y</varname>
  parameters determine the spacing of the grid points in the
  <emphasis>x</emphasis> and <emphasis>y</emphasis> directions.  The
  number of points is determined by the parameters and the size of
  the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Domain"/>. The lower left
  corner of grid is placed at the lower left corner of the
  <classname>Domain</classname>'s bounding box, and points are
  inserted into the bounding box at the given spacing until they
  overflow on the top and right.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>show_x</varname> and <varname>show_y</varname>
  parameters govern whether the <emphasis>x</emphasis> and
  <varname>y</varname> positions of the points will be displayed along
  with the data.
