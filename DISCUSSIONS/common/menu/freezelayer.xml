<para>
  <command>Freezing</command> a &layer; prevents it from being redrawn
  when a <link linkend="Chapter-Graphics">graphics window</link> is
  updated, even if the object that the &layer; displays has changed.
  It will prevent a &layer; from being <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.File.Animate">animated</link> or
  being updated when the window's time changes.  The one exception is
  that if a frozen &layer; has never been displayed, it will be drawn
  once.
</para>
<para>
  In the GUI, freezing and unfreezing is accomplished by the checkbox
  in the the <guilabel>Freeze</guilabel> column of the <link
  linkend="Section-Graphics-LayerList">Layer List</link>.  It can also
  be invoked from the <guilabel>Layer</guilabel> menu in the graphics
  window's menu bar, in which case it acts on the currently selected
  layer.
</para>
<para>
  In text mode and in scripts, the &layer; is specified by its
  position <varname>n</varname> in the window's layer list.  The
  unlisted layers must be counted when computing <varname>n</varname>.
  This command isn't very friendly in scripts, because it can be hard
  to determine the parameter <varname>n</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  Frozen &layers; can be thawed with <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer.Unfreeze"/>.
