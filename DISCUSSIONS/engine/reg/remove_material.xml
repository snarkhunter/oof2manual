  <para>
    <classname>RemoveMaterial</classname> is a <xref
      linkend="RegisteredClass-MeshModification"/> subclass, used as
    the <varname>modifier</varname> argument to the <xref
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Modify"/> command. It removes the
    &material; that was explicitly assigned to the target elements by
    <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AssignMaterial"/>.  After removal,
    the elements' &materials; will be determined in the usual way by
    the &micro;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>target</varname> parameter specifies which elements
    will have their explicitly assigned &materials; removed.
