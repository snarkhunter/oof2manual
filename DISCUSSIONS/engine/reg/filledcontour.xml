<para>
  <classname>FilledContourDisplay</classname> draws a contour plot of
  a <link
  linkend="Section-Output-Scalar"><classname>ScalarOutput</classname></link>
  quantity on a &mesh;.  The regions between successive contour
  levels are colored according to a color map.

  The arguments <varname>what</varname>, <varname>where</varname>,
  <varname>min</varname>,
  <varname>max</varname>,<varname>levels</varname>, and
  <varname>nbins</varname> have the same meaning as in <xref

<para>
  The <varname>colormap</varname> argument determines how the output
  values are translated into colors. The map translates real numbers
  in the range (0,1) into colors.  Contour levels are associated
  with colors by scaling the range (<varname>min</varname>,
  <varname>max</varname>) to (0, 1), and applying the color map.
  The region between one contour level and the next higher level is
  filled with the color associated with the lower of the two levels.
