    This command executes Python scripts, such as files created by the
    commands in the <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.File.Save"/> menu
    using the <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-FileFormats-Script"><constant>script</constant></link>
    format, or log files of &oof2; sessions.  It can also execute
    <emphasis>any</emphasis><footnote><simpara>It needs to be a
    well-written script using a compatible version of
    Python.</simpara></footnote> Python script.  Loading the log of an
    &oof2; session will recreate the session, more or less.  See the
    remarks in <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.File.Save.Python_Log"/>.

  <para>
    By loading a saved script, one can easily reproduce the previous
    status down to every minute detail. However, due to the randomness
    of some &skel; operations, it may produce something different. To
    avoid this, one should run &oof2; in a <emphasis>debug</emphasis>
    mode (see <xref linkend='Table:options'/>) when saving/loading a
    script : randomness will be contained in a
    <emphasis>debug</emphasis>. Unfortunately, it may not work, if a
    script is ported to another platform.
