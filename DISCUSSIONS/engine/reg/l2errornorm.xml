<para>
  <classname>L2ErrorNorm</classname> is one way of computing the error
  in an element when using the <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ZZ_Estimator"/> to drive finite element
  mesh <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdaptiveMeshRefine">adaptation</link>.  The
  relative percent error is
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
	  \[
	  \mathrm{percent\ error} = \frac{\int_\Omega\,
	  (\sigma^* - \sigma_h)^T
	  (\sigma^* - \sigma_h)\, d\Omega}
	  {\int_\Omega\,\sigma^{*T} \sigma^*\,d\Omega} \times 100
	  \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">\(\sigma^*\)</alt>
  </inlineequation>
  and
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">\(\sigma_h\)</alt>
  </inlineequation>
  are the recovered stress and the finite element stress,
  respectively.  The integral is over the area of the mesh element.
