<para>
  Lattice symmetries are given by the Schoenflies notation for point
  groups, as specified in the <ulink
  url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_point_group"
  role="external">Wikipedia page on crystallographic point
  groups</ulink>.  Because &oof2; is expecting a simple character
  string, subscripts appear as normal text.  For example, the
  Schoenflies symbol
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \(C_{2v}\)
    </alt>
  </inlineequation>
  is just <varname>C2v</varname> in &oof2;.
