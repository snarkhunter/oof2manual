<para>
  <command>API_Listing</command> dumps information about all of the
  &oof2; menu items and their parameters to a file. It's mostly used
  for generating the documentation that you're reading now, but it
  may also be useful for creating external drivers for &oof2;.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>filename</varname> parameter specifies the file to
  which the listing will be written. Any existing file of the same
  name will be overwritten.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>format</varname> parameter determines whether the
  file will be written as plain text or in XML format.  The XML
  listing is more complete, but less readable without some further
  processing.  The best way of reading the XML output is to read the
  manual, which you're doing now.
</para>
<para>
  The XML output assumes the <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org"
  role="external">DocBook</ulink> DTD.  Processing it requires a large
  number of external files containing the verbose descriptions of the
  commands, images, and other &oof2; objects.  These files are not
  distributed with &oof2;.  Anyone who wishes to generate the manual
  themselves can acquire these files by sending e-mail to
  <email>oof_manager@list.nist.gov</email>.
