  <para>
    This is a variation of the <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-AverageEnergy"/> criterion for accepting
    or rejecting &skel; <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-SkeletonModifier">modifications</link>.
    For a modification to be accepted, it not only has to lower the
    average <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Energy">effective
    energy</link> of the associated &elems; but it has to satisfy
    limits in the changes of these &elems;.  This criterion is best
    suited for putting finishing touches on the skeleton.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>homogeneity</varname> and
    <varname>shape_energy</varname> parameters are thresholds that
    <emphasis>each</emphasis> divide the &elems; into two classes:
    good (homogeneity above the threshold or <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Shape_Energy">shape
    energy</link> below the threshold), and bad (homogeneity below the
    threshold or shape energy above the threshold).  The rule for
    accepting a modification is that the average energy must decrease,
    <emphasis>and</emphasis> bad elements must not get worse. Good
    elements may get worse, but may not cross the thresholds and
    become bad.
