  Set the number of digits to use point when displaying floating point
  numbers in the GUI.  In order for changes to be take effect, you may
  need to close and reopen pages.

<para>
  The default number of digits is 6.  If you need 10 digits instead,
  put the line
  <literallayout class="monospaced">
    OOF.Settings.GUI_Digits(10)
  </literallayout>
  in your <link
  linkend="Section-oof2rc"><filename>.oof2rc</filename></link> file.

  <para>
    This <emphasis>can</emphasis> have an effect on numerical
    operations, if you're not careful.  Sometimes &oof2; fills in a
    value for you, and then uses that value for input.  For example,
    if a &property; parametrization dialog box has two parameters,
    <varname>P0</varname> and <varname>P1</varname> and you set
    <varname>P0</varname> to <userinput>0.33333333333</userinput>,
    then close the dialog and reopen it with <varname>digits</varname>
    set to 2, <varname>P0</varname> will be displayed as 0.33.  If you
    then click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>, perhaps after changing
    <varname>P1</varname>, <varname>P0</varname> will be changed from
    0.33333333333 to 0.33.
