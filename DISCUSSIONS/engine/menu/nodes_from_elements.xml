  <command>OOF.NodeSelection.Select_From_Selected_Elements</command>
  provides three ways of selecting &nodes; based on a pre-existing
  &elem; selection.  The two parameters <varname>internal</varname>
  and <varname>boundary</varname> control which &nodes; will be
  selected.  If <varname>internal</varname> is
  <userinput>True</userinput>, then the &nodes; that are completely
  surrounded by selected &elems; will be selected.  If
  <varname>boundary</varname> is <userinput>True</userinput>, then
  &nodes; that are <emphasis>not</emphasis> completely surrounded by
  selected &elems; will be selected.

        (a) With <code>boundary=True</code> and
        <code>internal=False</code>, only the &nodes; (blue dots) on
        the perimeter of the set of selected &elems; are selected.

        (b) With <code>boundary=False</code> and
        <code>internal=True</code>, only the &nodes; in the interior
        of the &elem; set are selected.
      </simpara>
      <simpara>
        (c) With both parameters <code>True</code>, all nodes that are
        part of a selected &elem; are selected.
