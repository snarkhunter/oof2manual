  <para>
    Generalized Force boundary conditions apply a generalized force at
    all nodes on a boundary.  A generalized force is a divergence of a
    &flux;, so Generalized Force boundary conditions correspond to
    components of <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Equation-Divergence">Divergence
    Equations</link>.  For example, applying a Generalized Force
    boundary condition to the <link
    linkend="Equation-Force_Balance">Force Balance</link> equation
    applies a (non-generalized) force to each node.  Applying it to
    the <link linkend="Equation-Heat_Eqn">Heat</link> equation makes
    each node in the boundary a point source or sink of heat.  The
    <varname>equation</varname> parameter specifies to which equation
    the boundary condition applies.
  </para>
  <para>
    The boundary condition is applied independently at each node, and
    is therefore sensitive to node density.  That is, increasing the
    number of nodes on the boundary will increase the total force
    applied to the system.  This is in contrast to <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-NeumannBC">Neumann</link> boundary
    conditions, which apply a force density to a boundary, and are
    insensitive to node density.
  </para>
  <para>
    Generalized Force boundary conditions may only be applied to <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Point">Point</link>
    boundaries.  They should be used only when the forces are actually
    pointlike.  To apply a constant pressure along an edge of a
    system, for example, <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-NeumannBC">Neumann</link> boundary
    conditions are more appropriate.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>profile</varname> parameter determines the force
    values along the boundary.  Profiles may be arbitrary functions of
    position, and are specified by providing a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-ProfileXT"/> object.
