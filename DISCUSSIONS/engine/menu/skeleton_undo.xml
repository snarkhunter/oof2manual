  <para>
    Each &skel; maintains a stack of previous incarnations of itself.
    Whenever a &skel; is <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Modify">modified</link>, a new
    version is pushed onto the stack.  The <command>Undo</command>
    pops the latest version off of the stack, thereby reverting to the
    previous version of the &skel;.  The popped version is not
    destroyed &#x2014; it can be recovered with the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Redo"/> command.
  </para>
  <para>
    The &skel; stack is not infinite.  When it is full, the oldest
    version of a &skel; will be lost when a new modification is made.
