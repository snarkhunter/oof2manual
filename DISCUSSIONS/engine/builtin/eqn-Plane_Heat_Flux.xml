<para>
  The Plane Heat Flux &equation; is
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ {\bf J}_z = 0 \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\bf
  J\)</alt></inlineequation> is the <xref linkend="Flux-Heat_Flux"/>.
  Activating the Plane Heat Flux equation is one way to reduce a three
  dimensional problem to <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-3D">two
  dimensions</link>.  Its role in thermal conduction problems is
  analogous to the role of the <xref linkend="Equation-Plane_Stress"/>
  equation in elasticity problems.
</para>
<para>
  When the Plane Heat Flux equation is activated, no heat will flow in
  the z direction, although the out-of-plane gradient of the <xref
  linkend='Field-Temperature'/>, <varname>Temperature_z</varname>, may
  be nonzero and will have to be solved for.
