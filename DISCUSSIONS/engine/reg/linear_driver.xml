  <para>
    <classname>LinearDriver</classname> is a <xref
    linkend="RegisteredClass-Driver"/> object, used as the
    <varname>solver</varname> argument to the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Solver"/> command. It applies the given
    <varname>method</varname> exactly once to find a solution of the
    <link linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Equation.Activate">active</link>
    &equations; that are defined on the &mesh;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The best <varname>method</varname> depends on the problem being
    solved.  Some solvers, such as <link
    linkend="RegisteredClass-CGSolver">conjugate gradient</link>, only
    work on symmetric matrices.  &oof2; notices when a problem is
    asymmetric and won't allow the wrong kind of solver to be applied.
