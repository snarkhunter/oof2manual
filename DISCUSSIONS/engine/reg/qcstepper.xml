<para>
  <classname>QCTimeStepper</classname> objects describe ways of taking

  stolen from an old copy of Numerical Recipes.</simpara></footnote>
  time step when <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-Solving">solving</link> a time
  dependent problem.  Given a set of &field; values at time
  <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(t\)</alt></inlineequation>, they
  compute a set of new values at time <inlineequation><alt
  role="tex">\(t+\delta t\)</alt></inlineequation>.  The difference
  between <classname>QCTimeStepper</classname> and <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-TimeStepper"/> is that
  <classname>QCTimeStepper</classname> also returns an error estimate.

<para>
  <classname>QCTimeStepper</classname> is used for the

  [At the moment there is only one subclass of
  <classname>QCTimeStepper</classname>, but our intention is to add
  more.  (If we've added more and haven't updated the manual, please
  ignore the previous sentence.)]
