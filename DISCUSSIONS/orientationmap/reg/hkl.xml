<para>
  This <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-OrientMapReader"/> reads data
  files produced by HKL<footnote>
  <simpara>
    This interface between HKL files and &oof2; was created at the
    request of &oof2; users and does not represent an endorsement by
    NIST.
  </simpara>
  </footnote> EBSD devices.  There is no guarantee that it
  is up to date.  It was written to read files that were provided to
  us as examples 10 or more years ago, and is not based on any formal
  file specification.  If this <classname>HKL</classname> reader does
  not work, try using <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-GenericReader"/>
  instead.
</para>
<para>
  The HKL data file is expected to look like this.  Items in bold are
  keywords that &oof2; expects to find. <footnote>
    <simpara>
      &oof2; isn't actually paying much attention to the keywords.  It
      assumes that they're in the order given, and it doesn't bother
      to check that <code>YCells</code> comes after
      <code>XCells</code>, for example.
    </simpara>
  </footnote>
  Words in angle
  brackets (like <code>&lt;this&gt;</code>) describe numbers that
  &oof2; that oof2 will read.
</para>

<programlisting>
  [Header lines above XCells are ignored]
  <emphasis role="bold">XCells</emphasis> &lt;number of cells in the x direction&gt;
  <emphasis role="bold">YCells</emphasis> &lt;number of cells in the y direction&gt;
  <emphasis role="bold">XStep</emphasis> &lt;step size in the x direction&gt;
  <emphasis role="bold">YStep</emphasis> &lt;step size in the y direction&gt;
  [More header lines that are ignored]
  <emphasis role="bold">Phase</emphasis> [more column names, also ignored]
  &lt;phase&gt; &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; [ignored] [ignored] &lt;Euler angles&gt; [ignored...]
</programlisting>
<para>
  The last line is repeated for each data point. There should be
  <code>XCells*YCells</code> data lines.  The Euler angle data is
  three columns containing the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Bunge"/>
  angles <varname>phi1</varname>, <varname>theta</varname>, and
  <varname>phi2</varname> in that order.
</para>
<para>
  The first column of the data section contains phase information in
  the form of an integer.  Each pixel will be added to a <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-Pixel_Group">pixel
  group</link> named <userinput>Phase_X</userinput>, where
  <userinput>X</userinput> is the phase number from the data file.
</para>
