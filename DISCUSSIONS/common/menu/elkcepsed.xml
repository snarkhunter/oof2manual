<para>
  <command>Elkcepsed</command> is the opposite of <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection.Despeckle"><command>Despeckle</command></link>.
  Instead of filling holes in the selection by selecting more pixels,
  it deselects small islands and peninsulas of of selected pixels.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>microstructure</varname> parameter specifies the
  &micro; where the selection resides.
</para>
<para>
  The algorithm works by recursively deselecting all selecting pixels
  with fewer than <varname>neighbors</varname> selected neighbors
  (examing the 8 immediately adjacent pixels).  Values greater than 4
  are prohibited because they will always deselect the entire &micro;.

	  <para>
        The lefthand image shows a set of selected pixels, in red.
        The other images show the results of running
        <command>Elkcepsed</command> with various values of
        <varname>neighbors</varname>.  For
        <varname>neighbors</varname>=1, only isolated single pixels
        have been deselected.  With <varname>neighbors</varname>=2,
        <emphasis>straight</emphasis> lines one pixel wide have also been deselected.  With
        <varname>neighbors</varname>=3, <emphasis>curved</emphasis> lines one pixel wide
        have also been deselected.  Finally, with
        <varname>neighbors</varname>=4, smaller blobs and protrusions
        are deselected.
