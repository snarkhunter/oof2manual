    If a &micro; is being built from an &image; which has a one-to-one
    correspondence between pixel color and &material;, then the most
    convenient way to assign &materials; to pixels is to automatically
    create a &pixelgroup; for each color, and then to <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Material.Assign">assign</link> &materials;
    to the pixels in each pixel group.  The
    <command>AutoGroup</command> command performs the first part of
    this process, creating pixel groups for each color of pixel in the
    given &image;.
  </para>
  <para>
    The <varname>name_template</varname> parameter specifies how the
    names for the automatically created groups will be generated.  It
    should be a string containing either <userinput>%c</userinput> or
    <userinput>%n</userinput> or both.  When naming a group,
    <userinput>%c</userinput> will be replaced by the color of the
    pixels in the group, and <userinput>%n</userinput> will be
    replaced by an integer.  Note that <userinput>%c</userinput> often
    leads to unwieldy names, such as
    <userinput>RGBColor(red=0.97254901960784312,green=0.9882352941176471,blue=0.0)</userinput>.
    It may be advisable to manually <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelGroup.Rename">rename</link> the groups.

    The <varname>name_template</varname> parameter is new in &oof2;
    version 2.0.4.  To reproduce the pre-2.0.4 behavior, set
    <varname>name_template</varname> to <userinput>%c</userinput>.

      Images produced by drawing programs that use antialiasing to
      smooth lines are generally not suitable candidates for
      <command>AutoGroup</command>.  Even if an antialiased image
      appears to contain only a few colors, it will generally have
      many slightly different colors at the borders between regions,
      and <command>AutoGrouping</command> will create a large number
      of groups.  On antialiased images it's best to select pixels
      with, for example, <xref
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection.Color_Range"/> and assign
      them to a group manually with <xref
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelGroup.AddSelection"/>.
