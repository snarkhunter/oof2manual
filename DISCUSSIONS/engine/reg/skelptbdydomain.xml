<para>
  <classname>Domain</classname> objects are part of the post-solution
  <link linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Analyze">analysis</link> framework,
  in which useful data is extracted from the &mesh;. The
  <classname>Domain</classname> is the subset of the &mesh; to which
  the <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> is
  applied.  When the domain is set to
  <classname>SkeletonPointBoundaryDomain</classname>, output is
  evaluated at the points in the &mesh; corresponding to the nodes in
  the &skel; <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Point">point
  boundary</link>.
</para>
<para>
  <classname>SkeletonPointBoundaryDomain</classname> domains support
  <link linkend="RegisteredClass-SampleSet">sampling</link> methods in
  the <link linkend="Sampling-point">point</link> category.

  <para>
    Evaluating outputs at the nodes of a &skel; <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Point">point
    boundary</link> is sort of weird, because if the &skel; point
    boundary contains more than one &node;, it's possible that the
    corresponding boundary in the &mesh; should contain intermediate
    nodes, if the &mesh; elements are high order.
    <classname>SkeletonPointBoundaryDomain</classname> is provided for
    completeness, but probably only makes sense when the boundary in
    question consists of a single &node;.  The same consideration
    applies to setting <link
    linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition">boundary
    conditions</link> on a point boundary.
