  The <varname>source</varname> parameter is the <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Path">path</link> to a &micro; or
  &image;.  If it's an &image;, the selection is made in the &micro;
  in which the &image; resides.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>points</varname> parameter is a <link
  linkend="Object-list">Python list</link> of <link
  linkend="Object-Point"><classname>Points</classname></link> in the
  &micro;.  Only the first point in the list is used.  The &oof2; GUI
  puts only one point in the list &emdash; the position of the mouse
  when the mouse button is <emphasis>released</emphasis>. If the
  button is released outside the &image; or &micro;, no action is
  taken.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname>
  parameters govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of objects defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the objects
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>) the
  shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click that
  initiated this command.

	        The previous selection is retained, and the current

	        The previous selection is toggled at all members of the
	        current selection.  That is, all members of the new
	        selection are in the previous or current selections, but

	        Members of the current selection are kept only if they
	        were also members of the previous selection. That is,
	        the new selection is the intersection of the previous
	        and current selections.
