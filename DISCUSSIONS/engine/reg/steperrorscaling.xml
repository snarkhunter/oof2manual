<para>
  <classname>StepErrorScaling</classname> subclasses determine how to
  compute the error estimate when solving a &subproblem; with adaptive
  time-stepping in <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdvancedSolverMode"/>.  The
  <varname>errorscaling</varname> parameter of <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdaptiveDriver"/> is a
  <classname>StepErrorScaling</classname> object.  The <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AdaptiveDriver"/> adjusts the timestep so
  that the error estimate returned by the
  <classname>StepErrorScaling</classname> object is less than, but not
  much less than, the given <varname>tolerance</varname>.
</para>
<para>
  When a time-evolution calculation with adaptive stepping is failing
  because the step size is too small, it's often due to a poorly
  chosen error scaling method.
