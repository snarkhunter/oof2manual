    Delete a &layer; from the &layerset; that's being edited by the
    &layereditor;.  This doesn't actually delete it right away.  The
    &layer; is replaced by a placeholder (shown as
    <guilabel>&lt;deleted&gt;</guilabel> in the GUI), and is deleted
    from the Graphics window when the &layerset; is <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet.Send">sent</link> from
    the &layereditor;.  Doing it this way ensures that deleting
    &layers; from &layersets; with multiple &layers; actually deletes
    the correct &layers; in the Graphics window.
