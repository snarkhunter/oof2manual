  <para>
    Create a &skel; by converting the pixels of the &micro; directly
    into elements.  If <varname>skeleton_geometry</varname> is <xref
    linkend='RegisteredClass-QuadSkeleton'/>, then each pixel leads to
    one quadrilateral element.  If
    <varname>skeleton_geometry</varname> is <xref
    linkend='RegisteredClass-TriSkeleton'/>, each pixel will be split
    into two triangular elements, with the direction of the split
    determined by the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-TriSkeleton"/>
    <varname>arrangement</varname> parameter.  The various geometries
    are illustrated in <xref linkend="Figure-initskel"/>.
