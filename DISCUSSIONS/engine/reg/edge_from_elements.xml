<para>
  <classname>EdgeFromElements</classname> is a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-BoundaryConstructor"/>, used as the
  <varname>constructor</varname> argument of the <xref
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Skeleton.Boundary.Construct"/> command when
  building &skel; <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary">boundaries</link>.  It
  creates <link linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Boundary-Edge'>Edge
  Boundaries</link> from the currently <link
  linkend='MenuItem-OOF.ElementSelection'>selected</link> &skel;
  &elems; or from a <link
  linkend='Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Groups'>group</link> of &elems;.
  The &elems; are specified by the <varname>group</varname> parameter,
  which must be either the name of an &elem; group or the special
  <xref linkend="Object-Placeholder"/> object,
  <userinput>selection</userinput>.
</para>
<para>
  The boundary is constructed from the &sgmts; that are on the
  perimeter of the given <varname>group</varname> of &elems;.  &sgmts;
  that are shared by two &elems; in the group will not form part of
  the boundary.  It is not possible to construct an edge boundary from
  a set of non-contiguous &elems;.
</para>
<para>
  Edge boundaries must be constructed from a single contiguous
  non-branching set of &sgmts;, and they must be
  <emphasis>directed</emphasis>.  <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-BoundaryCondition">Boundary
  conditions</link> use the direction to determine the boundary normal
  and the direction of applied &fields; and &fluxes;.  The
  <varname>direction</varname> parameter specifies the direction of
  the boundary being created.  The legal values for
  <varname>direction</varname> generally depend on the topology of the
  boundary being constructed.  The edges bounding a set of &elems;
  always form a closed loop, so the legal values of
  <varname>direction</varname> are <userinput>'Clockwise'</userinput>
  and <userinput>'CounterClockwise'</userinput>.
</para>

<para>
  <xref linkend="Figure-edge_from_elements"/> shows some
  examples of edge boundaries created from &elems;, and of sets of
  &elems; from which it's impossible to create boundaries.

        Note that only the outer boundary of the selected elements
	    has been used to construct the boundary.
        (c) The boundary is necessarily closed, so the allowed

        <userinput>Counterclockwise</userinput>.
