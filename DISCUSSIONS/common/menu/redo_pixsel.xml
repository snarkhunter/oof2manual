  <para>
    A &micro; maintains a stack of sets of selected pixels.  Whenever
    pixels are selected or deselected, a new selection set is pushed
    onto the stack. The <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>
    command pops the topmost set off the stack, thereby reverting to
    the next older selection.  The <command>Redo</command> command
    undoes the <link
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>,
    by replacing the most recently popped selection onto the stack.
  </para>
  <note>
    <para>
      Undone selections can be redone only if no new selections have
      been made in the &micro; since the time of the last <link
      linkend="MenuItem-OOF.PixelSelection.Undo"><command>Undo</command></link>
      command.
