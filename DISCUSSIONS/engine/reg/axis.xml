<para>
  An <classname>Axis</classname> object describes the orientation of
  an object in three dimensional space, in terms of an axis
  direction, and an angle of rotation about that axis.  When used
  for crystal orientation in &oof2;, the indicated rotation brings
  the crystalline &ahat;, &bhat;, and &chat; axes into coincidence
  with the laboratory (or screen) axies &xhat;, &yhat;, and &zhat;
  respectively.  The components of the rotation axis itself are
  preserved by the rotation, and so may be specified in either the
  crystalline or the laboratory coordinate systems.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>x</varname>, <varname>y</varname>, and
  <varname>z</varname> parameters specify the rotation axis.  The
  axis passes through the origin and the point
  <inlineequation>
    <alt role="tex">\((x,y,z)\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>.
    The vector
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\((x,y,z)\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    does not have to be a unit vector, but there is no information in
    its magnitude.
</para>
<para>
  The parameter <varname>angle</varname> specifies the rotation
  angle, in degrees.
