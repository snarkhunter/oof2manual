<para>
  Pinning internal boundaries is especially useful when cleaning up a
  &skel; that has been adapted to the material boundaries of a
  &micro;.  <xref linkend="Figure-pininternal"/>(a) shows a &skel;
  with pinned internal boundary nodes.  <xref
  linkend="Figure-pininternal"/>(b) shows the same &skel; after having
  been <link linkend="RegisteredClass-Smooth">smoothed</link>.  The
  pinned nodes have not moved, although the <varname>targets</varname>
  parameter for <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Smooth"/> was set to
  <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-AllNodes"/>.

<para>
  Note that &nodes; on internal boundaries in a &skel; do not
  necessarily lie exactly on the pixel boundaries in a &micro;.  A
  &node; is considered to be on an internal boundary if it is part of
  two &elems; with different <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">dominant
  pixels</link>.  <xref linkend="Figure-pininternal-detail"/>(a) shows
  a detail from <xref linkend="Figure-pininternal"/>(a) where the
  pinned &nodes; are clearly not on the pixel boundaries.  When the
  &elems; are colored according to their <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Skeleton-Homogeneity">dominant
  pixels</link> as in <xref linkend="Figure-pininternal-detail"/>(b),
  it is clear that the pinned nodes are actually boundary nodes of the
  &skel;.
