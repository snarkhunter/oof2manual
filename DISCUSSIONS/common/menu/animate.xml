<para>
  The <command>Animate</command> command animates the contents of the
  graphics window.  After a time dependent problem has been solved,
  the command causes the graphics window to recompute and redisplay
  its time dependent &layers;, using data from the different times
  stored in the displayed &meshes;.  The times stored in a &mesh; are
  the times at which <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Outputs">Scheduled Outputs</link> were
  requested when the &mesh; was being <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Mesh.Solve">solved</link>.
</para>
<para>
  The only &layers; that will be animated are those whose
  <varname>when</varname> parameter is set to <link
  linkend="Object-Placeholder"><userinput>latest</userinput></link>.
  Layers that do not have a <varname>when</varname> parameter, or
  whose <varname>when</varname> parameter is set to anything other than 
  <link linkend="Object-Placeholder"><userinput>latest</userinput></link>,
  will be drawn but will not change during the animation.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>start</varname> and <varname>finish</varname>
  parameters to <command>Animate</command> set bounds on the times
  that will be displayed.  <varname>start</varname> must be less
  than <varname>finish</varname>.  The <varname>times</varname>
  parameter determines how the intermediate times between
  <varname>start</varname> and <varname>finish</varname> will be
  selected.  It can be set to select the times stored in a single
  &mesh;, or all the times stored in all &meshes;.  It can also be set
  to select evenly spaced times between <varname>start</varname> and
  <varname>finish</varname>.  If any of the display times is not
  stored in the &mesh;, data will be generated by linear interpolation
  between the nearest stored times.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>frame_rate</varname> parameter determines how many
  time slices will be displayed each second.  &oof2; will attempt to
  display the requisite number, but may not be able to attain it if
  it's displaying a lot of data.  A future version (later than 2.3.2)
  may be able to precompute and cache frames to speed up the
  animation.
</para>
<para>
  The <link
  linkend="RegisteredClass-AnimationStyle"><varname>style</varname></link>
  parameter determines whether or not the animation runs just once or
  repeatedly, and which direction it goes.  Any animation can be
  halted via the <link
  linkend="Section-Windows-ActivityViewer">Activity Viewer</link>
  window.  This is especially important for those that run repeatedly,
  since they won't stop otherwise.
</para>
<para>
  <command>Animate</command> can be run from the
  <guimenuitem>File</guimenuitem> menu in the <link
  linkend="Chapter-Graphics">Graphics</link> window's menu bar.
