<para>
  This command assigns an <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/> to a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/>, thereby determining
  what happens to the data after it's been computed.
</para>
<para>
  Different kinds of <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-ScheduledOutput"/>s require different kinds
  of <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputDestination"/>s.  For
  example, <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-GraphicsUpdate"/> only
  allows a <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-GfxWindowDestination"/>,
  which is automatically assigned by the <link
  linkend="Section-Tasks-ScheduledOutput">Scheduled Output</link>
  page.  Generic text-based output must go to a <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-MessageWindowStream"/> or <xref
  linkend="RegisteredClass-OutputStream"/> destination.  The &oof2;
  GUI will only permit appropriate assignments.
