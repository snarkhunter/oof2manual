<para>
  Dim the given <varname>image</varname> by making each pixel blacker.
  Each color component <emphasis>x</emphasis> (red, green, or blue) is
  replaced by <emphasis>x</emphasis> &times;
  <varname>factor</varname>.  If <varname>factor</varname> is 1, then
  there is no change, but if <varname>factor</varname> is 0, the image
  becomes completely black.  Values between 0 and 1 are most useful.
