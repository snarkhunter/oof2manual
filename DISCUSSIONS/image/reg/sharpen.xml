<para>
  Sharpen an &image; by enhancing the difference between it and a
  blurred version of itself, by calling <ulink
  url="https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.unsharp_mask"
  role="external"><code>skimage.filters.unsharp_mask</code></ulink>.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>radius</varname> is the standard deviation of the gaussian,
  in pixel units.  If <varname>radius</varname> is too small, the
  algorithm may enhance noise in the image. 
  <varname>amount</varname> is the factor by which
  the sharp features are enhanced.  Large values may lead to
  cartoonish images.
</para>
<para>
  If <varname>mode</varname> is <constant>RGB</constant> the
  sharpening is applied to each of the color channels independently.
  This can lead to odd color changes as seen in <xref
  linkend="Figure-Sharpen-RGB"/>.  Setting <varname>mode</varname> to
  <constant>HSV</constant> sharpens only the
  <emphasis>value</emphasis> channel in an HSV representation of the
  image, and does a better job of preserving color, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Figure-Sharpen-HSV"/>.
