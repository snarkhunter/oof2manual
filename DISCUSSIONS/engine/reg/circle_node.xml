<para>
  <command>CircleNodeSelect</command> is a <link
  linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Toolbox.Select_Node">selection
  method</link> that selects &nodes; in response to a mouse click in
  the <link linkend="Chapter-Graphics">graphics window</link> when the
  <link linkend="Section-Graphics-SkeletonSelection">Skeleton
  Selection</link> toolbox is active and is set to <quote>Node</quote>
  mode.  It selects all &nodes; lying within a circle swept out by
  dragging the mouse, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Figure-circle_nodes"/>.  Click the mouse in the center of
  the circle and drag out along a radius.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>skeleton</varname> is the &skel; from which the &nodes; are
  to be selected.
</para>
<para>
  <varname>points</varname> is a <xref linkend="Object-list"/> of
  <xref linkend="Object-Point"/> objects.  The first point in the
  list is the center of the circle, and the second point is a point
  on the circumference.  Any other points in the list will be ignored.
</para>
<para>
  The <varname>shift</varname> and <varname>ctrl</varname> parameters
  govern how the current selection
  (<foreignphrase>i.e,</foreignphrase> the set of &nodes; defined by
  this operation) is merged with the previous selection (the &nodes;
  already selected) to form a new selection, as shown in <xref
  linkend="Table:ShiftCtrl"/>.  They indicate whether
  (<userinput>True</userinput>) or not (<userinput>False</userinput>)
  the shift and control keys were depressed during the mouse click
  that initiated this command.
