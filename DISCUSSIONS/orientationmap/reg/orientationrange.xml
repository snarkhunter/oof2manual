<para>
  Select all pixels whose <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Material-Orientation">orientation</link>
  in the &micro;'s <link
  linkend="Section-Concepts-Microstructure-OrientationMap">Orientation
  Map</link> is within the given <varname>misorientation</varname> of
  a reference <varname>orientation</varname>.  This command does not
  work with orientations given by the <xref
  linkend="Property-Orientation"/> &property;.
</para>
<para>
  The misorientations are computed as if all of the materials pixels
  have the given <varname>lattice_symmetry</varname>, no matter what
  material properties have been assigned to them.
