<para>
  The Plane Polarization &equation; is
  <equation>
    <alt role="tex">
      \[ {\bf D}_z = 0 \]
    </alt>
  </equation>
  where <inlineequation><alt role="tex">\(\bf
  D\)</alt></inlineequation> is the <xref linkend="Flux-Total_Polarization"/>.
  Activating the Plane Polarization equation is one way to reduce a three
  dimensional problem to <link linkend="Section-Concepts-Mesh-3D">two
  dimensions</link>.  Its role in electrostatic problems is
  analogous to the role of the <xref linkend="Equation-Plane_Stress"/>
  equation in elasticity problems.
</para>
<para>
  When the Plane Polarization equation is activated, there will be no
  polarization in the z direction, although the out-of-plane gradient
  of the <xref linkend='Field-Voltage'/><footnote><simpara>Also known
  as the negative of the z-component of the electric
  field.</simpara></footnote>, <varname>Voltage_z</varname>, may be
  nonzero and will have to be solved for.
</para>
<para>
  (For obscure historical reasons, the name of the Plane Polarization
  equation is <varname>InPlanePolarization</varname>, which is not in
  keeping with the names of other equivalent equations in &oof2;.  It
  should be <varname>Plane_Polarization</varname>.  We apologize for
  the confusion.)
