  <para>
    The <command>New</command> command in the <xref
    linkend="MenuItem-OOF.Graphics_n.Layer"/> menu doesn't actually
    create a new graphics &layer;.  Instead, it opens and clears the
    &layereditor; window.  The &layereditor; can then create a new
    &layer;.
  </para>
  <para>
    In text mode, this command doesn't do anything.  To create
    graphics layers in text mode, use the &layereditor; commands in
    the <xref linkend="MenuItem-OOF.LayerEditor.LayerSet"/> menu.
