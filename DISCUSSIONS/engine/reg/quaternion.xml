  <para>
    A <classname>Quaternion</classname> object represents the
    orientation of a three dimensional object, assumed to be a
    crystal, in three dimensional space in terms of four parameters
    which obey an interesting algebra.  This representation of
    orientations is not common, but has its roots in the rigid-body
    mechanics community.
  </para>
  <para>
    The parameters correspond to a physical rotation in a similar way
    to the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Axis"/> convention.  Given a
    rotation angle
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(\theta\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    and a normalized rotation axis
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\( \hat{\mathrm{\bf n}} \)</alt>
    </inlineequation>, the quaternion parameters follow
    directly:
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(e_0\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    is the cosine of half the
    rotation angle, and
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(e_1\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>,
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(e_2\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>,
    and
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\(e_3\)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    are,
    respectively, the x, y, and z components of    
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\( \hat{\mathrm{\bf n}} \)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    multiplied by the sine of half the rotation angle.
  </para>
  <para>
    As in the case of the <xref linkend="RegisteredClass-Axis"/>
    convention, the specified rotation brings the crystalline &ahat;,
    &bhat;, and &chat; axes into coincidence with the laboratory (or
    screen) axes &xhat;, &yhat;, and &zhat; respectively.  The
    components of 
    <inlineequation>
      <alt role="tex">\( \hat{\mathrm{\bf n}} \)</alt>
    </inlineequation>
    are preserved by this rotation, and so may be specified in either
    the crystalline or laboratory coordinate system.
